Track 38  
T: So, we said that lo and la and los and las, become le and les. The four become two. The four 
options of lo, la, los, las become le and les when it’s to him, to her, for him, for her . And we said 
that me, te, and nos, they don’t change to get these different meanings. They stay as they are. And 
we also saw that these words, me, te, and nos could mean myself, yourself, ourselves or each other . 
So how would you say I speak to myself ?  
S: Me hablo .  
T: Me hablo . We speak to ourselves :  
S: Nos hablamos .  
T: Nos hablamos . Although, of course, the more natural meaning you would probably understand 
from nos hablamos  is we speak to eac h other , as nos also means each other . Now to get the 
meaning of himself, herself, themselves, lo and la and los and las become se. Which is very easy 
to remember because it’s the beginning of self. So when we want this meaning of self or selves , 
we get se. So, to recap: me, te, and nos, they already have the meanings included of myself , 
yourself , ourselves,  each other , but these ones that change, the small words that change, lo, la, los 
and las, to get the meaning of himself , herself , themselves  is going t o be se. So let’s practice it. He 
speaks to himself.  How would you say that?  
S: Se habla .  
T: Se habla . You could say the word for he. What is the word for he?  
S: Él. Él se habla .  
T: Él se habla . She speaks to herself , and clarify. Use the word for she.  
S: Ella. Ella se habla .  
T: Ella se habla . Good. They speak to themselves :  
S: Se hablan .  
T: Se hablan . Se habla . Se hablan . Se. There’s no change. I speak to myself:S: Me hablo .  
T: Me hablo . Good. So here we are not using se. For me, te and nos we h ave all of the meanings 
included in me, te, and nos. Good. Tell me again how is they speak :  
S: Hablan .  
T: Good, but the accent was -  
S: HA-blan .  
T: Hablan . They speak to them.  Now a different them.  Not themselves . Ah, they speak to them . This 
group is speaking to another group.  
S: Les hablan .  
T: So now we can go back to a verb like to stay , to remain was quedar . So to get the meaning of stay, 
you say I remain myself . So how was that?  
S: Me quedo .  
T: Good. Me quedo . We remain ourselves or we stay:  
S: Nos quedemos .  
T: -ar verb.  
S: Nos quedamos .  
T: Nos quedamos . Good. And you stay , talking informally. You remain yourself :  
S: Te quedas .  
T: Te quedas . Are you staying?:   
S: ¿Te quedas ?  
T: Aren’t you staying? :  
S: ¿No te quedas ?  
T: Why don’t you stay? :S: ¿Por qué no te quedas ?  
T: Good. ¿ Por qué no te quedas ? Good. Let’s just practice the words for emphasis as well. So you 
could say I am staying.  What is the word for I:  
S: Yo.  
T: Yo. I’m staying. I’m remaining myself:   
S: Yo me que do.  
T: Yo me quedo . Good. What was the word for we? Not us, but we?  
S: Nosotros .  
T: Nosotros . So we have nosotros  for we. How would you say we are staying ? We are remaining 
ourselves :  
S: Nosotros nos quedamos .  
T: Good. Nosotros nos quedamos . And if you are an all female group, nosotros  will change.  
S: Nosotras .  
T: Good. Nosotras nos quedamos  if you are an all female group. What is the word for you in the 
sense of if we want to clarify or emphasize you are staying , speaking informally. Not te, but:  
S: Tú.  
T: Tú. Good. So how would you say you are staying - emphasizing that we mean you?  
S: Tú te quedas .  
T: Tú te quedas . Good. So these are the versions actually we were practicing before with me, te, and 
nos. We didn’t look at he stays , because actu ally what we needed to say he stays is he remains 
himself and we didn’t have that yet. But now we do.  
S: Se - it’s queda .  
T: Good. That’s it. Se queda . He stays. She stays. You stay. They stay,  or they remain themselves :  
S: Se quedan .T: Se quedan . Good. Querer  was to want . Querer.  What was I want ?  
S: Quiero .  
T: Quiero . The / e/ of querer  splits when we put the stress on it. Quiero . Now if you want to say I 
want to stay, you say,  I want to remain myself.  So how is that?  
S: Quiero quedarme .  
T: Go od. Quiero quedarme . He wants to remain himself or she wants to remain herself, he wants to 
stay, she wants to stay :  
S: Quiere quedarse .  
T: Good. Quiere quedarse . She wants to stay . Ella quiere quedarse . He wants to stay . Él quiere 
quedarse . You (formal)  want  to stay . Usted quiere quedarse . What if you wanted to say they 
want to stay or you guys want to stay ?  
S: Quieren quedarse .  
T: Quieren quedarse . So this could mean they want to stay or you guys want to stay . How would you 
clarify? Let’s clarify they want to stay :  
S: Ellos quieren quedarse .  
T: Good. And what if it was a female group?  
S: Ellas quieren quedarse .  
T: Ellas quieren quedarse . Good. And you guys :  
S: Ustedes quieren quedarse .  
T: Good. Ustedes quieren quedarse . And we said that while usted  is formal, ustedes , the plural you, 
is not necessarily formal. Quedarse  is the version of the verb that you are going to find in the 
dictionary. So in the dictionary you will find quedar  and all of the different meanings of quedar  
which is remain  and the various other meanings, actually, this verb has, could be used like to fit . 
Me queda bien . It fits me well. It suits me well . And then you will find the next entry: quedarse . 
And then you will find next to it to stay . So when this reflexive, when this  “doing it to oneself” 
carries a different meaning, it will get a different entry in the dictionary. And it’s not going to bein the dictionary as quedarme , or quedarte , or quedarnos , but quedarse  because this se is also 
like oneself . No? If it’s himself, herself, itself ; it’s also like oneself . So in the dictionary what you 
find is to remain oneself . Quedarse . The se is written like one word. Whenever we put se, lo, me, 
te, nos, one of these small words at the end of the “to” form, it’s written like one wo rd. You write 
it all together. Let’s practice this just with one more verb. We said that to get the sense of realize, 
I realize . In Spanish you say to give yourself account . Which is a little bit like to take acount of in 
English. Now you need to look at darse cuenta  to know how to manipulate it to get the different 
versions of it that you might want. So let’s begin with I realize. I realize. I give myself account .  
S: Me doy - me doy cuenta .  
T: That’s it. Me doy cuenta . I don’t realize :  
S: No me doy cuent a.  
T: No me doy cuenta . Good. We realize , or we give ourselves account :  
S: Nos damos cuenta .  
T: Good. Nos damos cuenta . Perfect. We don’t realize :  
S: No nos damos cuenta .  
T: Good. No nos damos cuenta . Now we can make the other versions with he, she, i t and you formal 
and they and you guys because we have se. So now we can do this. So how would you say he 
realizes or she realizes ? Go back to dar.  
S: Da- se da cuenta .  
T: Good. Se da cuenta . What if we wanted to clarify? She - she realizes :  
S: Ella se da cuenta .  
T: Good. Ella se da cuenta . Good, and they realize :  
S: Se dan cuenta .  
T: Good. And they don’t realize :  
S: No se dan cuenta .T: No se dan cuenta . So this could be they don’t realize or you guys don’t realize . Well done.
