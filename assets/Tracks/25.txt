Track 25  
T: So we’ve seen how me can mean me, to me or myself and te can mean you, to you or yourself . And 
nos can mean us, to us or ourselves . So we want to resist the temptation to translate this to. So for 
example: he speaks to me , we don’t need this to because me, me, can mean me, to me or myself . 
So we w ant to resist the temptation to translate that to. So how do you say: he speaks to me or he 
is speaking to me ?  
S: Habla me . Sorry, me habla.   
T: Yeah, don’t let that to confuse you about the position it should go. It’s still going before, me habla . 
They speak to me :  
S: Me hablan .  
T: Good! If you want to say they speak to me about it , you can just  say they speak me it in Spanish.  
S: Me lo hablan .  
T: Me lo hablan . Very good. They are speaking to me about it . So this to and this about  we notice 
Spanish  tends not to need these words as much as English does. For example to buy was comprar , 
comprar .  
S: Comprar .  
T: Good. So this me other than to me can be for me , from me , we don’t really need these words. So  
for example,  if we want to say he buys i t for me we can just say he buys me it . So comprar  is to 
buy. He buys it for me , he buys me it :  
S: Me lo compra .  
T: Good. Me lo compra . So here we see me is like for me here but it’s just me, we are just using me. 
I buy it for you , speaking informally.  I buy it for you :  
S: Te lo compro .T: Good. Te lo compro . Now, if you want to say shall I buy it for you,  shall  in English, all it's doing 
really is just making it a question. Shall I buy it for you?  So in Spanish just make it sound like a 
questio n.  
S: ¿Te lo compro ?  
T: Yeah! ¿ Te lo compro ? Shall I buy it for you?  Now this could actually even mean from you . Shall 
I buy it from you? So by the context we will understand the difference. Maybe you will hear if you 
travel to a Spanish speaking country  people say “buy me", selling things in the street. “Buy me 
something” is what you will hear. And they are probably not asking you to buy them something 
but to buy something from them. And it’s understood and we don’t really need to use these words 
like from  or for most of the time. To do was hacer , hacer . How would you say do you want to do  
(speaking informally) ?  
S: Hacer  is an irregular verb.  
T: It doesn’t matter, does it? Do you want to do ?:  
S: Ah! ¿ Quieres hacer ?  
T: Good. Do you want to do it?   
S: ¿Quieres hacerlo ?  
T: Good. ¿Quieres hacerlo ? Now how do you think you would say: do you want to do it for me? :  
S: ¿Me lo quieres hacer ?  
T: Yes. ¿ Me lo quieres hacer ? So, we are not using the word for for. We don’t need it in Spanish, 
it’s understoo d. Do you want to do it for me? ¿ Me lo quieres hacer ? ¿Quieres hacérmelo ? Good. 
The kitchen in Spanish is la cocina , /la cosina/, or in most of Spain, /la cothina/. La cocina .  
S: La cocina .  
T: And to cook is cocinar . You just make a verb from cocina, cocinar . Actually this is where we get 
concoction , concoction  from in English, “with cooking”. So how would you say I cook  from 
cocinar ?  
S: Cocino .T: Good. How do you say he cooks or she cooks or it cooks or usted , you (formal) cook ?  
S: Cocina .  
T: Good. You (informal )?  
S: Cocinas .  
T: Good. And with emphasis or clarification if you want to use the word for you?  
S: Usted .  
T: But this is informal, cocinas .  
S: Ah sorry! Tú cocinas .  
T: Tú cocinas . Good. They cook or you guys ?  
S: Cocinan .  
T: Go od. What if you wanted to use the word for they, to emphasize or to clarify?  
S: Ellos cocinan .  
T: Ellos cocinan . Good. Or ellas if it’s a female group. Or if you wanted to say you guys are cooking  
with the emphasis or the clarification?  
S: Ustedes cocin an.  
T: Good. Ustedes cocinan . And we cook ? What is we cook ?  
S: Cocinamos .  
T: Good. And with the emphasis or the clarification?  
S: Nosotros cocinamos .  
T: Good. Nosotros cocinamos . Good. How would you say I can ? How is I can , related to power ?  
S: Puedo .  
T: Puedo . Good. And he can :  
S: Puede .T: Good. Puede . And you can (informal):  
S: Puedes .  
T: Good. Can you cook? :  
S: ¿Puedes cocinar ?  
T: Good. Can you cook something for me?  So what was the word for something ?  
S: Algo .  
T: Good. How do you thi nk you are gonna say this in Spanish? Can you cook something for me? :  
S: ¿Me puedes cocinar algo ?  
T: Good. ¿Me puedes cocinar algo ? ¿Puedes cocinarme algo ? Either way. So how would you say 
I have cooked ? I have cooked :  
S: He cocinado .  
T: He cocinado . Good. So we said that this tense of have cooked , I have cooked  instead of I cooked,  
we can use it more in Spanish than in English. So for example in English i t sounds much more 
natural to say I cooked at 6 o’clock , but in Spanish it’s not a problem to sa y I have cooked at 6 
o’clock . So, at 6 o’clock  is a las seis . What you actually mean when you say a las seis  is a las seis 
horas . “At the six hours”. A little bit like in English when you say “at sixteen hundred hours". A 
las seis . So how would you say I have cooked at 6 o’clock ? I cooked at 6 o’clock :  
S: He cocinado a las seis .  
T: Good. He cocinado a las seis . I have cooked at six o’clock . I cooked at six o’clock . Good. The 
word for eight  in Spanish is ocho . Ocho .  
S: Ocho .  
T: Ocho . We have this similar  root in octagon , you know , a shape with eight sides. Or octopus,  which 
has eight legs. Or in October , which, well now it’s the tenth month, in the Roman calendar there 
were only ten months and October was month number eight. So, ocho , eight . How would yo u say 
we have cooked at eight o’clock ? We have cooked at eight o’clock :S: Hemos cocinado a las ocho .  
T: Good. Hemos cocinado a las ocho . The word for nine in Spanish is nueve .  
S: Nueve .  
T: We can see in November , which used to be the ninth month. Th e o splits into ue, nueve . And we 
have the same with ten. Ten is diez or /dieth / in most of Spain. Diez. What does that sound like, if 
you go back to our calendar?  
S: December ?  
T: December , which used to be the tenth month and of course again an example of splitting. Dec to 
diez. Quedar  in Spanish, quedar , means to remain , or to be left over and it actually has quite a 
few other meanings as well, it’s quite a flexible verb, quedar . But for now, to remain or to be left 
over. Q-u-e-d-a-r. Quedar . And q-u in Spanish is always a k sound. You must resist any temptation 
to pronounce / qwedar /, if you were to read this. The word que, the word for what  that we learned 
is spelled q-u-e. Quiero  is spelled q-u-i-e-r-o. So q-u this combination is always a k. Quedar 
means to remain . So in Spanish if you want to say I stay  actually you say I remain myself . This is 
the way you say I stay  in Spanish. So we start with remain  which is quedar . So how do you say I 
remain ?  
S: Quiedo .  
T: It doesn’t split here but good fo r trying.  
S: Quedo ?  
T: Quedo . I remain myself ?  
S: Me quedo .  
T: Me quedo . This means I stay . Me quedo . Until , until in Spanish is hasta . Hasta . H-a-s-t-a. You 
may have heard hasta la vista . Until the view , literally until the seeing , until we see each other . 
Hasta la vista . So now you can say I am staying here until ten o’clock . So let’s divide it up. I am 
staying here, I remain myself here:   
S: Me quedo aquí.T: Until ?  
S: Hasta .  
T: Ten o’clock . So-  
S: Las diez .  
T: Yes. Las diez . It’s literal ly like las diez horas , but you don’t say horas . Maybe historically people 
said it , but not anymore. Me qu edo aquí , or acá, hasta las diez . Good. I am staying until ten 
o’clock . So if me quedo , I remain myself is I am staying , how do you think you would say we are 
staying ?  
S: Nos quedemos .  
T: Good , but now you have some vowel harmony popping in because we were concentrating on the 
other bit , so this mistake managed to come back.  
S: Quedamos ?  
T: Good! Because it’s  quedar . No? Nos quedamos . We rem ain ourselves . We stay . So we are staying 
until nine o’clock :  
S: Nos quedamos hasta las nueve .  
T: Good. Nos quedamos hasta las nueve . Very good. Very good. You stay or you remain yourself  
(speaking informally) :  
S: Te quedas .  
T: Good. Te quedas . You ar e staying here :  
S: Te quedas aquí.  
T: Te quedas aquí. Are you staying here? :  
S: ¿Te quedas aquí ?  
T: Good. ¿ Te quedas aquí ? How would you make it emphatic now? Are YOU  staying here?  
Because this te is not emphatic, it is not optional. Yo u have to put this me in me quedo  to get themeaning of stay and we have to put this te in te quedas  to get the meaning of stay. But if we 
want to make it emphatic, what do we add?  
S: Tú te quedas ?  
T: Good. I am staying , emphatic.  
S: Yo me quedo .  
T: Go od. Yo me quedo . Good. We are staying :  
S: Nos quedamos .  
T: Nos quedamos . Good. WE are staying :  
S: Nosotros nos quedamos .  
T: Nosotros nos quedamos . Very good.
