Track 75  
T: What was to do or to make ?  
S: Hacer .  
T: Hacer . We said that for the informal positive command, we have a shortcut. We find the you 
version of th e verb, haces , and we take away the s. “Hace”. But with hacer  we have an irregularity. 
The informal command for hacer  is haz. H-a-z. So in most of Spain, you will hear / hath/. Haz.  
S: Haz.  
T: So if you want to say do it:  
S: Hazlo .  
T: Hazlo . Good. Anot her use of the mood tense is to turn words like where  into wherever . What was 
where ?  
S: Donde .  
T: Donde . So of course we can’t use the mood tense with donde  because it’s not a verb. How do you 
say where you want , where you want , speaking informally ?  
S: Donde quieres .  
T: Donde quieres . Good. Now if we want to say wherever you want , then to get wherever actually 
we can change the verb to the mood tense and that changes the feeling of where . And then where  
turns into wherever . So i f you want to say wherever you want , still informally:  
S: Donde queras .  
T: I want to hear well though the i and the e in quieras .  
S: Donde quieras .  
T: Good. Donde quieras . So do it wherever you want :  
S: Hazlo donde quieras .  
T: Good. Hazlo donde quieras . What was you like it , still informally ? You like it :S: Te gusta .  
T: Te gusta . How would you say do it how you like to do it - so do it how you like.  What was the 
word for how? How are you called? What’s your name? :  
S: Cómo .  
T: Cómo . Good. So do it how it pleases you. Do it how you like :  
S: Hazlo como te gusta.  
T: Good. Hazlo como te gusta . Do it how you like to. Do it how you like to do it.  Now, what if you 
wanted to give the meaning do it however you like ?  
S: Hazlo como te guste .  
T: Hazlo como te guste . In English we are changing how to however  and in Spanish we are changing 
te gusta to te guste . Hazlo como te guste . How would you say do what you prefer ? Do what you 
prefer . Still informal:  
S: Haz lo q ue preferes.  
T: And:  
S: Prefieres .  
T: Very good. Haz lo que prefieres . So what we are investigating here is an optional use of the mood 
tense, no? Because haz lo que prefieres is perfect Spanish. It just means do what you prefer . But 
if you want to give  the meaning do whatever you prefer how will you change that?  
S: Haz lo que prefieras.  
T: Good. Haz lo que prefieras . Do whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you 
prefer , speaking informally:  
S: Comes lo que prefieras .  
T: Comes lo que prefieras would be you eat whatever you prefer . Comes lo que prefieras , which is 
a way of saying it. You could say it like this. Comes lo que prefieras . It just sounds actually alittle sweeter. You eat whatever you prefer , rather than eat whatever you  prefer . But, here we are 
working with the order. We have a shortcut where we are not using the mood tense, what is it?  
We have comes , you eat . And what do we do to get the order?  
S: Come .  
T: Come . Good. So making the order, even though your sentence wa s very nice and very sweet, 
comes lo que prefieras . Let’s make it an order. Eat whatever you prefer :  
S: Come lo que prefieras.  
T: Very good. Come lo que prefieras . Now make this formal. Eat whatever you prefer , but speaking 
formally:  
S: Coma lo que pref iera.  
T: Very good. So here we have two mood tenses. We have coma  which is the order and then prefiera , 
giving us whatever  from what . Coma lo que prefiera . What if you were speaking to more than 
one person? Eat whatever you prefer :  
S: Coman lo que prefie ran.  
T: Good. Coman lo que prefieran . Good. What was to need  in Spanish? Sounding more like to 
necessitate .  
S: Necesitar .  
T: Necesitar . Good. Whenever you need . Whenever you need. How do you say that? Speaking 
informally:  
S: Cuando necesites ?  
T: Very good. Cuando necesites . Whenever you need . Good. We said that to choose was like elect .  
Elegir . Elegir . How would you say I choose ?  
S: “Elejo .”  
T: And we had some change happening with that e.S: Ahh, yes. Elijo .  
T: Elijo . Good. Elijo . You choose , speaking informally:  
S: Eliges .  
T: Eliges . To follow and also to continue or to carry on , we can use this verb like that, is seguir .  
Seguir . So it’s to follow or to continue , to carry on . Seguir .  
S: Seguir .  
T: And this behaves like elegi r in that the e will not split, it will just turn into an i when we stress it.  
So how do you say I continue or I follow ?  
S: Sigo.  
T: Sigo. And there are some other verbs that come from seguir . We have conseguir , to get or to 
manage to . We have persegu ir which means to chase . And we will see the same irregularity in 
them. The I version of conseguir , consigo . Perseguir , persigo . So like we said before, we can 
generalize the irregularities in Spanish. So sigo, I follow, and how about he, she, it follows , or you 
(formal) follow :  
S: Sigue .  
T: Sigue . You (informal):  
S: Sigues .  
T: They or you guys :  
S: Siguen .  
T: But we:  
S: Seguimos .  
T: Seguimos . Good. We are not stressing the e so it escapes from the irregularity. Seguimos . Good. 
So we could say someth ing like I’ll follow you wherever you go . So, we can say I will follow youor we can just use the present I follow you . Because, the wherever you go is a future context 
informally.  
S: Te sigo.  
T: Te sigo. Good. Wherever you go . So this is actual ly to wherever you go . Wherever you go to, to 
wherever you go . So how would you say to where ?  
S: Adonde   
T: Adonde . Good. And you go (informally) and we want the mood tense which is irregular.  
S: Is it vaya ?  
T: Yes. Very good. So now we can say the whole sentence. I’ll follow you wherever you go. To 
wherever you go , informally:  
S: Te sigo adonde vaya - vayas.  
T: Good. Very good. Another irregular verb in the mood tense is ser. The base for the mood tense of 
ser is sea. Sea. S-e-a.  
S: Sea.  
T: And you’ll hear the very common expression o sea , o sea . Literally meaning something like “or it 
might be”. O sea, o sea is just like this kind of way to break up speech whilst you’re thinking what 
to say like an uhhh . So sea is the base for the  mood tense. So if you want to say something like I 
prefer that it be like this. I prefer that it’s like this. I prefer for it to be like this. Of course we say 
I prefer that it be like this . What was the word for like this or like that ?  
S: Así.  
T: Goo d. So I prefer that it be like this, I prefer it to be like this :  
S: Prefiero que lo - do we, no we don’t use lo here.  
T: Good.  
S: Prefiero que sea así.  
T: Very good. Prefiero que sea así . What does sea lo que sea  mean?S: Whatever will be will be .  
T: Whatever it is, whatever will be, will be . Sea lo que sea . Whatever will come.  Good.
