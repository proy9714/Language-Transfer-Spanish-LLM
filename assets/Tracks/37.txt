Track 37  
T: What was the verb to give , do you remember the verb to give ?  
S: Dar.  
T: Dar. Good. So how would you say I will give ?   
S: Daré .  
T: Good. And we will give :  
S: Daremos .  
T: Good. And he will give  or she, you (formal), it:  
S: Dará .  
T: Good. They, you guys :  
S: Darán .  
T: And you (informal):  
S: Darás .  
T: Good. How would you say Will you guys give it to me?  Now, me – me – can also mean to me , so 
we don’t need that to. And out of these little words, me, and what is the word for it?  
S: Lo.  
T: Lo. So out of these little words, me and lo, the personal one, the one referring to the person, comes 
first. Will you  guys give it to me? :  
S: ¿Me lo darán ?  
T: Good. ¿ Me lo darán ? What if this it was a feminine thing?  
S: ¿Me la darán ?  
T: Good. ¿Me la darán ? And I should clarify, this isn’t a way of requesting, like in English, Will you 
guys give it to me? , like Can yo u guys give it to me?  This is more of a literal question, Are youguys going to give it to me? Will you guys give it to me?  If you want to get this meaning of will 
you like can you , you will just use can you  in Spanish. The word for something  is algo. A-l-g-o.  
S: Algo .  
T: Good. So how would you say They will give you something , and we mean informal you? Remember 
the thought process. The thought process must be, first, “Who is doing the verb? Who is doing the 
verb?” They will give . That’s the firs t place :  
S: Darán .  
T: You something :  
S: Te darán algo .  
T: Te darán algo . Good. How would you say They will give it to you , still speaking informally ?  
They will give it to you :  
S: Te lo darán .  
T: Good. Te lo darán . They will give it to you.  Good. How would you say They will give it to us, they 
will give it to us :  
S: So it’s Nos lo darán .  
T: Good. Nos lo darán . They will not give it to us :  
S: No nos lo darán .  
T: Good. No nos lo darán . So we saw that me, te, nos can mean me or to me , you or to you, us or to 
us, or even in some other circumstances for me  or for us , for you . Me, te, nos can also mean myself , 
yourself , and ourselves . For example, you can say I give myself  and you will just use me. So how 
would you say I give myself ?  
S: Me doy ?  
T: Me doy . If you want to say I realize  in Spanish, you say me doy cuenta . Cuenta  is something like 
account , to give yourself account of, to take account of . That’s how you say I realize  in Spanish.If you say realizar  it means to realize  like a project, to bring into fruition, no? So you say I give 
myself account , cuenta . So how would you say that?  
S: Me doy cuenta .  
T: Me doy cuenta . This means I realize. You realize , talking informally?  
S: Te das cuenta .  
T: Good. Te das cuenta . How would you make tha t a question?  
S: ¿Te das cuenta ?  
T: Good. ¿ Te das cuenta ? This is used a lot conversationally. ¿ Te das cuenta ? Do you realize?  Do 
you know what I mean?  Do you know what I’m saying?  Good. We realize, we realize, we give 
ourselves account :  
S: Nos damos cu enta.  
T: Good. Nos damos cuenta . So me can mean to me , for me , from me . It can mean myself . Te can 
mean you or to you , from you , yourself . And nos: us, to us , or ourselves  or each other . We said 
that you might hear nos vemos – we see each other – as a w ay to say ciao, goodbye . Nos vemos . 
We see each other later. See you later . Now, you get all of these different meanings with me, te, 
and nos, but the ones beginning with l, so lo, la, los, las , they do change to get these different 
meanings. So when we sa y to him or to her or to you (formal) or to them  we go from lo and la and 
los and las to le and les. So lo and la become le, and los and las become les. For example, lo doy 
means I give it . Now, if I want to say I give him , what I actually mean is I give to him, in which 
case here we must change to le. If I say I give her , I don’t mean I’m going to pick her up and give 
her to somebody. I probably mean I give to her . In which case we’re not going to use la, we’re 
going to use le. So let’s practice this a lit tle bit. So we said dar is to give . Now, if you say I give 
it, how do you say that?  
S: Lo doy .  
T: Lo doy . And I give them  and you still are talking about the things you are giving?  
S: Los doy .T: Los doy . But now if you want to say I give them  and you mean to them . So remember you might 
not even say this to in English. But what you mean is I give to them , then this los is going to change.  
S: Les doy .  
T: Les doy . Good. The word for something  was?  
S: Algo .  
T: Algo . So let’s say I’m giving them somethi ng:  
S: Les doy algo .  
T: Les doy algo . Good. So this is to them . To speak, to speak,  began with a silent h. I don’t know if 
you remember this verb.  
S: Hablar .  
T: Hablar . Good. So how do you say I speak ?  
S: Hablo .  
T: Hablo . How would you say I have s poken ? I have :  
S: He.  
T: Yes. He. So I have spoken :  
S: He, is it hablando ?  
T: No. This is speaking  and spoken  is very similar.  
S: He hablado .  
T: He hablado . Good. I have spoken to him :  
S: Le he hablado .  
T: Good. Le he hablado . I have spoken to hi m or to her . Could be either. Now what if you wanted to 
say We have spoken to him ?  
S: Le hemos hablado .T: Good. Le hemos hablado . So this le, it could be the lo to le, or the la to le. So many meanings are 
included here. It could be We have spoken to him, We have spoken to her, We have spoken to you 
(formal) , speaking to male or female. Le hemos hablado . How was he has ? Or she has  or it has , 
from haber ?  
S: Ha.  
T: Ha. Good. H-a. Ha. He has spoken :  
S: Ha hablado .  
T: Good. They have spoken :  
S: Han h ablado .  
T: Han hablado . They have spoken about it, they have spoken it :  
S: Lo han hablado .  
T: Good. They have spoken to him  or to her :  
S: Le han hablado .  
T: Good. Le han hablado . They have spoken to them . I mean one them  spoken to a different them .  
They have spoken to them :  
S: Les han hablado .  
T: Very good. Les han hablado . Good. So we had ver, to see . The version for I see  was a little bit 
irregular, how was it?  
S: Veo.  
T: Veo. Good. A little bit irregular, not “vo” as it should be, v-o, it’s veo, v-e-o. Good. So if you want 
to say I see it  or I see him  or I see you , talking formally:  
S: Lo veo .  
T: Lo veo . What if you saw a feminine thing or if you saw her or if you saw you (formal), talking to 
a female?S: La veo .  
T: La veo . What if you were seeing las casas , what if you meant I see them , and you’re referring to 
feminine things?  
S: Las veo .  
T: Las veo . And what else could it mean, then? Other than I see them , talking about things?  
S: I see them , meaning women.  
T: Or? What else?  
S: You, females.  
T: Yeah. I see them , females, I see you guys , females, or I see them , feminine objects. Good. We said 
that the kitchen  is la cocina and to make the verb you can just stick an r on cocina  and you get?  
S: Cocinar .  
T: Cocinar , with the accent o n the end. Cocinar . Now in English if I say He’s cooking me something,  
I can say He’s cooking me something  or He’s cooking something for me . Both are acceptable in 
English. So we’re not looking for the direct translation, we’re looking for the feeling more  than 
anything. We want to identify the feeling of “is it to me , is it for me , or is it directly me?” Is he 
cooking me?  So it’s the feeling that we want to get our heads around more than the direct 
translation of whether we’re using to or not in English. F or example,  I listen to him . Here we’re 
using to in English, with listen . But we don’t use it with hear. I hear him . I listen to him . So we’re 
not looking for direct translation of when we’re using to and for or not. What we’re trying to do is 
generally pe rceive, ok, am I being cooked? Am I being spoken? Am I coming out of somebody’s 
mouth? Ah? Or is it indirect, am I being cooked for? Am I being given to? So, like I said, with me, 
te and nos it doesn’t matter anyway, because they won’t change. So if I want  to say He’s cooking 
me, and I mean he’s directly cooking me in the oven, or if I mean he’s cooking something for me, 
then the sentence isn’t going to change anyway in Spanish. So how would you say that? He is 
cooking me something,  he is cooking me somethi ng:  
S: Me cocina algo .  
T: Good. Me cocina algo . Now let’s say He’s cooking something for us :S: Nos cocina algo .  
T: Good. Nos cocina  algo. He’s cooking something for you , speaking informally:  
S: Te cocina algo .  
T: Good. So me, te, nos we don’t have t o worry about them. They don’t change. But if I want to say 
He is cooking him something , how would I say it?  
S: Le cocina algo .  
T: Very good. How would you say He is cooking them something ?  
S: Les cocina algo .  
T: Good. Les cocina algo . What if you wa nted to say He is cooking them  and with this them  you are 
referring to the things he is cooking? Not to the people he is cooking for.  
S: Los cocina algo .  
T: Eh, we don’t need the algo anymore.  
S: Los cocina .  
T: Los cocina . And if he was cooking femi nine things, like las tartas , the tarts , for example, how 
would it be? He’s cooking them :  
S: Las cocina .  
T: Good. Now if you wanted to say He’s cooking them for us  and we still mean feminine things, let's 
stay with las tartas . He’s cooking them for us , how would it be?  
S: Nos las cocina .  
T: Perfect. We don’t need for or any of this and we put the personal one first. Nos las cocina . Good.  
Again, what was to speak ?  
S: Hablar .  
T: Good. I speak :  
S: Hablo .T: Good. I speak to him :  
S: Le hablo .  
T: Le hablo . Good. And I’m speaking to them :  
S: Les hablo .  
T: Good. They are speaking to them:   
S: Les hablan .  
T: Good.
