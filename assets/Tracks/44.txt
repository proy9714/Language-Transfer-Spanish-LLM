Track 44  
T: What was the  word for problem  in Spanish?  
S: Problema .  
T: Problema . And the problem:   
S: El problema .  
T: El problema . Good. We can see it ends in an a, so we would expect it to be feminine, but we saw 
that these words ending -ma in Spanish, many of them entered t hrough Greek. And in Greek they're 
neuter, but they look a bit masculine in Greek, so they came into Spanish as masculine words even 
though they end in a. So we have el problema . System :  
S: Sistema .  
T: Sistema . The system :  
S: El sistema .  
T: Good. The p aradigm: how do you think that would be in Spanish?  
S: El paradigma .  
T: El paradigma . Good. Scheme  also came in from Greek. But scheme  in Spanish means outline  or 
diagram . How do you think that would be?  
S: El squima . Squema . El squema .  
T: Good, and s omething else to make it sound a bit more Spanish?  
S: El esquema .  
T: Very good. El esquema . We said that we cannot start s plus another consonant in Spanish. We 
have to put an e before, like Spain , España , spaghetti , espagueti . El esquema , so this would be 
outline  or diagram . Diagram  is another one of these words. How do you think that would be in 
Spanish?  
S: Diagrama .T: Good. And the diagram :  
S: El diagrama .  
T: El diagrama . Good. So mostly, words ending / o/ are masculine and words ending / a/ are fem inine, 
but we might find some exceptions. Planeta , for example, what do you think that means? Planeta :  
S: Planet .  
T: Planeta  is a masculine word. So the planet :  
S: El planeta .  
T: El planeta . A planet :  
S: Un planeta .  
T: Un planeta , very good. How woul d you say the planets ?  
S: Los planetas .  
T: Very good, los planetas . Good. So this is a masculine word that looks feminine. How was the 
word for car? We saw various words.  
S: Auto .  
T: Auto , let's work with that one. How do you say the car ?  
S: El auto .  
T: The cars :  
S: Los autos .  
T: Los autos . Good. If you want to say this car , you say este auto . Este auto .  
S: Este auto .  
T: Good. We sa w esta noche , this night . What do you think is the difference between este and esta, 
then? If we have este auto  and esta noche , what do you think is the difference?  
S: Este is the masculine  -T: Good.  
S: And esta the feminine.  
T: Good. So, we see that noche  is a feminine word. How would you say the night ?  
S: La noche .  
T: La noche . The nights :  
S: Las noches .  
T: Good. But this night , or tonight :  
S: Esta noche .  
T: Esta noche . Good. If you take this t out of este and esta, the words for this, you get the word for 
that. So este auto  is this car . And that car  would be?  
S: Ese auto .  
T: Ese auto . How would you say I want that car ?  
S: Quiero ese auto .  
T: Good. I don't want that car, because it's very big. Big  is grand  so how would that be in Spanish?  
S: Grande .  
T: Grande . I don't want that car , because it's very big :  
S: No quiero ese auto, porque es muy grande .  
T: Very good. No quiero ese auto, porque es muy grande . How was this night ?  
S: Esta noche .  
T: And how would be that night ?  
S: Esa noche.   
T: Esa noche . We just get rid of the t and then we have the word for that. What if you wanted to say 
those n ights ?S: Esas noches .  
T: Esas noches . Good. There are also a few words that end in o which are feminine. For example, 
mano . Mano  means hand . Ends in o, but it's a feminine word. So how would you say the hand ?  
S: La mano .  
T: La mano . Good. The hand s:  
S: Las manos .  
T: Las manos . This hand :  
S: Esta mano .  
T: Good. That hand :  
S: Esa mano .  
T: Good. These hands :  
S: Estas manos .  
T: Good. We have this word in English, like in manuscript , manual , as well. Manual , manuscript , 
that man- bit there means  hand . Maintain , which in Spanish is mantener . We have main - or man- 
means hand . Manage . Manage  means to handle . Actually, it has a special use for handling horses, 
historically. Which is interesting, because to manage , manejar , is used in some Latin Ameri can 
countries to mean to drive . Other than to manage  or to handle , it also means to drive , manejar , 
which is interesting because this verb manage  historically had the special use to handle horses, 
and we see how that's kind of translated over the years to driving. How would you say Can you 
give me a hand? So this is a literal translation of something idiomatic in English, but it works in 
Spanish as well. In Spanish you say this. Can you give me a hand?  And let's talk informally.  
S: ¿Me puedes dar un mano ?  
T: But it's -  
S: Una mano .T: Good. ¿Puedes darme ?, or ¿me puedes dar ?, una mano . How would you say Could you give me 
a hand? Could you give me a hand? So could  is would can.   
S: ¿Me podrías dar una mano ?  
T: Good. ¿Me podrías dar una mano ? ¿Podrías  darme una mano ? You should give me a hand. 
You should give me a hand. Should is would owe . Still informal.  
S: Deber . Debería . You should . Deberías . Me deberías dar una mano .  
T: Me deberías dar una mano . Here we're not asking though, it sounded like a question.  
S: Oh, sorry.  
T: You should give me a hand.   
S: Oh, yes.  
T: Give it to me again, not like a question. Like a statement. You should give me a hand :  
S: Deberías darme una mano .  
T: Good. And what if you were speaking to more than one person?  
S: Deberían darme una mano .  
T: Good. Deberían darme una mano . You guys should give us a hand :  
S: Nos deberían dar una mano .  
T: Good. So we said that manejar  means to handle  or to manage . Manejar .  
S: Manejar .  
T: And also to drive , in some Latin Amer ican countries. How do you say I am managing the problem , 
or I manage the problem ?  
S: Manejo el problema .  
T: Good. So how would you say I'm managing the problem , and you mean right now. So I remind 
you that for managing , for -ar verbs to get this -ing, we take away -ar and we put -ando . And for-er/-ir verbs, for this -ing, we take away the -er or the -ir, and we put -iendo . First part is I am 
managing. I am managing:   
S: Estoy manejando .  
T: Good. I am managing the problem :  
S: Estoy manejando el  problema .  
T: Good. Estoy manejando el problema . So mano , we said, ends in o and it's feminine. It's actually 
kind of the only true word that ends in o and is feminine. So, for example we have la foto , the foto . 
But foto is short for fotografía . So it's a ctually la fotografía  becomes la foto . The same with la 
moto . The motorbike  is actually la motocicleta . No? Then people say moto  and foto and it stays 
with la. To take  in Spanish is tomar . Tomar .  
S: Tomar .  
T: Good. So how would you say I'm taking a photo , and you mean right now?  
S: Estoy tomando una foto .  
T: Good. Estoy tomando una foto . You might hear sacar  as well, for photo. Sacar  or tomar . Estoy 
tomando una foto. Estoy sacando una foto . Let's use tomar  for now. I would take a photo :  
S: Tomaría una foto.  
T: Tomaría una foto . I would like , so it would please me , to take a photo . So what is to please , or 
like?  
S: Gustar .  
T: Gustar . So it would please me,  I would like,  it would please me to take a photo:   
S: Me gustaría tomar una foto .  
T: Good. Me gustaría tomar una foto . But I don't have my camera. But I don't have my camera:   
S: Pero no tengo mi cámara .  
T: Good. All together. I would like to take a photo, it would please me to take a photo, but I don't 
have my camera :S: Me gustaría tom ar un foto -  
T: Fotografía.   
S: Una foto, pero no tengo mi cámara .  
T: Very good. Me gustaría tomar una foto, pero no tengo mi cámara . Very good.
