Track 48  
T: We said that for -ar verbs, we take away the -ar and we put -aba to get this line in the past. So 
cenar , to dine or to have dinner . Cenaba , I was having dinner, I was dining, I used to have dinner, 
I used to dine . Now for  -er/-ir verbs, we take away our -er/-ir ending and we put -ía. Where did 
we hear that before? -ía?  
S: The “would” tense.  
T: Comer  was to eat . How was I would eat ?  
S: Comería .  
T: Comería . Good. Now for the line in the past, we are not adding on to the  full verb. We are taking 
off our ending before we put -ía. So how would it be? I was eating, he was eating, she was eating , 
etc.?  
S: Comía .  
T: Comía . Vender  is to sell . Vender . I would sell it. I would sell it :  
S: Lo vendería .  
T: Lo vendería . I was selling it. I was selling it:   
S: Lo vendía .  
T: Lo vendía . Good. If you want to say for sale , you can just say it sells itself. It sells itself. It’s for 
sale. How would that be?  
S: Se vende .  
T: Se vende . Good. For sale.  Se vende . It sells itself. And i f you go to a Spanish speaking place, you 
will see on houses and on cars this expression. Se vende . It was selling itself, it was for sale :  
S: Se vendía .  
T: Se vendía . It would be for sale. It would sell itself :  
S: Se vendería .T: Se vendería . It would  sell itself. It would be for sale.  Good. What was to break  again? Related to 
rupture ?  
S: Romper .  
T: Romper . Good. How would you say I was breaking it ?  
S: Lo rompía .  
T: Lo rompía . Good. And if you just wanted to say it was breaking , and you mean by i tself. It was 
breaking , not something else. How would you say it?  
S: Se rompía .  
T: Se rompía . Good. How would you say they were breaking ?  
S: Se rompían .  
T: Se rompían . Good. Give me again the “to” form. To break :  
S: Romper .  
T: Romper . What is I wou ld break it ? I would break it :  
S: Lo rompía . Ah, lo rompería .  
T: Lo rompería . I would break it . How would you say I was breaking it ?  
S: Lo rompía .  
T: Lo rompía . Good. How would you say they would break it ? They would break it :  
S: Les?  
T: They would break  is where you need to begin.  
S: Romperían . Lo romperían .  
T: Lo romperían . They were breaking it, they were breaking it :  
S: Lo rompían .T: Lo rompían . So, we have the same endings for would  and for the line in the past for -er/-ir verbs . 
The big difference of course is that for would  we are adding on to the “to” form of the verb and 
for the past we are taking off our endings first, which means we get pairs like comería , I would 
eat; comía , I was eating . Rompería , I would break ; rompía , I was breaking . So how would you 
say it breaks , it breaks, and you mean it gets broken ? It breaks itself in the present tense:  
S: Se rompe .  
T: Se rompe . How would you say it’s going to break ? It’s going to break . How is we are g oing or 
let’s go ?  
S: Vamos .  
T: It is going to break.   
S: Se va a romper .  
T: Good. Se va a romper or va a romperse . So this means it’s going to break . It’s going to get 
broken and there we are not waiting to hear what it’s going to break because we hav e se. So we 
completed that structure. We completed the sentence with se. The word for how in Spanish is 
cómo.  If you want to ask somebody in Spanish, how do you say ? - so maybe you have a Spanish 
speaking friend that speaks English. And you want to use the m like a dictionary and say how do 
you say x, y, or z ? What you will say in Spanish is how does it say itself?  How is it said? How does 
it say itself? So this is another example of where you might be using this structure of self, which 
we are seeing in S panish is very flexible. It’s giving us many different meanings, this structure of 
myself, yourself, ourselves, itself, this structure. So it says  from decir  is dice. It's a little bit 
irregular, but then the other versions follow. So we have dice for he, she, it , or usted .  
How would you say, you (informal) say?  
S: Dices .  
T: Good. And they:  
S: Dicen .  
T: Dicen . And as we know the we form tends to escape the irregularity as the accent is somewhere 
else, so we go back to decir . And to say we say :S: Decimos .  
T: Decimos . Good. So how would you say, how is it said? How does it say itself? :  
S: ¿Cómo se dice ?  
T: ¿Cómo se dice ? So you will use this often. You don’t say “¿cómo dices?” This means how do you, 
as an individual, say... how do you say it? If you want to say, how is it said , ¿Cómo se dice?  How 
does it say itself?  
So se is doing quite a lot in Spanish. Sometimes we are using it to wrap up the sentence, to show 
that we are not using a verb “to” anybody or “to” anything else like in it breaks , or it transforms , 
these examples that we saw. Sometimes the se is changing the meaning like between quedar , 
remain , or be leftover and quedarse , to stay . And sometimes this se has quite a creative 
application. Se vende . It sells itself , for sale . Or, we c ould even have se habla . Se habla español . 
Spanish speaks itself. Spanish is spoken. Spanish spoken . Se habla español . Quedar  by itself 
means to remain . And you can use this in the sense of  I have one left . In Spanish, you will say  it 
remains to me one . This is the structure in Spanish.  I have one left . It remains to me one . So how 
would you say that?  I have one left . What is the word for one?  
S: Uno.  
T: Uno, or una if you are talking about a feminine thing. So I have one left, it remains to me one :  
S: Me quedo  un.  
T: That means I stay one.  So there you made the reflexive structure. You said  I remain myself and 
you got the meaning of  to stay . But what you want is it remains to me .  
S: Me queda un .  
T: Me queda uno . I have one left . Me queda uno . I have t wo left . If me queda uno is it remains to 
me one , I have one left . How do you think you would say I have two left ? The word for two is dos. 
Dos.  
S: Dos.  
T: Related to duo. So I have two left. They remain to me two :S: Me quedan dos .  
T: Me quedan dos . Very good. And of course we have the they form of the verb because it’s they 
remain . As I’m saying they remain to me, to me , how do you think it would be if you wanted to 
say he has two left ?  
S: Le quedan dos .  
T: Le quedan dos . Two of the m, they remain to him . Le quedan dos . He has two left or she has two 
left, or you (formal ) have two left . So maybe if you go to a shop and you ask for something and 
there’s none left, maybe they will say no me quedan . I don’t have any left . No me quedan, n o 
me queda , you will hear both just depending on what the person has in their mind. I have none 
left as in one. I have none left as in they’ve all gone . No me queda . No me quedan . But, we saw 
that with this verb then when we use this reflexive structure, this “self” structure, we get a different 
meaning. If I say  I remain myself then I get the meaning of to stay . I stay . So how is I remain 
myself ?  
S: Me quedo .  
T: Good. Me quedo . We remain ourselves :  
S: Nos quedamos .  
T: Nos quedamos . Good. He remains himself or she remains herself :  
S: Se queda .  
T: Se queda . They stay :  
S: Se quedan .  
T: Se quedan . Good. Ah, It’s all of those that begin with l - lo, la, los, las , all become se for the “self ” 
version. From hablar , to speak , if you want to say I was s peaking, he was speaking :  
S: Hablaba .  
T: Hablaba . So we have -aba as our key sound for the line in the past for -ar verbs. They were 
speaking :  
S: Hablaban .T: Good. So how do you say they were staying, they were remaining themselves ?  
S: Se quedaban .  
T: Se quedaban . Good. They weren’t staying here :  
S: No se quedaban aquí .  
T: Good. I wasn’t staying here :  
S: No me quedabo , no-  
T: So -aba works for I, he, she, it , and you formal.  
S: No me quedaba .  
T: No me quedaba aquí. And we were staying he re:  
S: Nos quedabamos aquí.   
T: The accent stays.  
S: Quedábamos .  
T: Nos quedábamos aquí . We weren’t staying here :  
S: No nos quedábamos aquí.   
T: No nos quedábamos aquí . Good. Now if you wanted to say we didn’t have any left , so here, what 
we will s ay is it didn’t , or they didn’t , we have the option, remain to us .  
S: No nos quedaban .  
T: Good. No nos quedaba or no nos quedaban . Good.
