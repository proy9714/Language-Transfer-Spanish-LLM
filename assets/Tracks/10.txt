Track 10  
T: How would you say to ventilate ?  
S: Ventilar.   
T: Yeah. Ventilación -ventilar . How would you say to separate ?  
S: Separar.   
T: Good. Separar.  So in English what we pronounce as separate , maybe like an e sound, but i f you 
look at how it’s written, it’s an a. Separar.  Good. So how was to know , something to do with 
savvy ?  
S: Saber.   
T: SaBer.   
S: Saber.   
T: With a b.  
T: Another way to remember this is Homo sapien , there’s that connection there. The Homo sapien  is 
the wise creature . Supposedly. And how was to come ? Convenient ?  
S: Venir.   
T: Venir.  Good. So we can remember that convenient  is “with coming”, when things come together, 
they are convenient. We’ve seen the “to” forms of the verb end in r and the “I” forms  most of the 
time end in o. For example, I want , how was that?  
S: Quiero.   
T: Quiero . I owe ? Which we can use like must :  
S: Debo.   
T: Debo . I try:   
S: Intento.T: Intento.  Unless the verb is irregular, and we know some irregular verbs already. We saw I am 
going .  
S: Voy.   
T: Voy. So that doesn’t end in o, or in /o/. Voy. It’s an irregular verb. So how does this work? Now 
all “to” verbs, all verbs in the “to” form, when we say to go , to want , to segregate , how would you 
say to segregate ?  
S: Segregation -segregación -segregar .  
T: There you are. All of them in the “to” form end in the letter r. They either end in -ar, -er, or -ir. 
We have an example of each. We have like a thousand examples of the ones that end in -ar because 
this is the  one that we’re using to build these from, for example, simulation -simulación -simular . 
Revelation -revelación -revelar . Respiration -respiración -respirar . What do you think respirar  
means?  
S: To breathe .  
T: Yes. To breathe. So we could say to respire  litera lly and we go, oh of course, this would be how I 
would say breathe in Spanish. Respirar.  Good. So we have many examples of -ar verbs. We have 
one example of an -er verb, in its “to” form, which is to know . How was that? To know:   
S: Saber.   
T: Saber . And we have the example of the verb ending -ir, ir, which is to come .  
S: Venir.   
T: Venir. Good . So all “to” forms are going to end in an r. And it’s either going to be -ar, -er, or -ir. 
a-r, e-r, i-r. In fact, and talking about “to” forms, it’s actually wi th this “to” that we identify what 
is a verb. Now it’s good to talk about this because at school we learn that verbs are doing words, 
which is really kind of unhelpful, because to be  for example is, there’s nothing, you’re not doing 
anything. If you say is, he is here , what is he doing? But is is a verb. Is is a verb because it comes 
from to be . We don’t say He be here . We say He is here . So the way we identify what is a verb, is 
that you can put to in front of it. To be, to stay, to go . These are verbs. And in Spanish, these are 
going to end in r. Either -ar, -er, or -ir. Now the way we get the “I” version, is we take off thisending, we chop off this -ar, -er, or -ir and we put -o. We have an example already. We know how 
is to try . What was to try ?  
S: Intentar.   
T: Intentar.  Good. And I try:   
S: Intento.   
T: Intento.  Good. So we take off -ar and we put on -o. But something else is happening as well.  
Intentar . Intento.   
S: The accent.  
T: Good. The accent. Intentar , we have the accent on the end. When  we put the -o, the accent is just 
before it. InTENto . Now this is extremely important. If I say intentO , if I put the accent on the 
end, it means something else. It means he tried.  Which is going to be useful for us later when we 
learn the past. For now, we need to think that the accent in the present tense is going on the 
penultimate syllable. The second to last syllable. Intentar  is not present tense. It has no tense. It’s 
the “to” form. To try . Part of the present tense, other than putting this -o for I, is also moving the 
accent: intento . How would you say to donate ?  
S: Donation -donación -donar .  
T: Good. Donar.  I donate . You take off the -ar and you put -o.  
S: Dono.   
T: Yes. Dono . I don’t donate or I’m not donating:   
S: No dono.   
T: Good. No dono . How was to create ?  
S: Crear.   
T: Good. Crear -creación -crear . I create:   
S: Creo.T: Creo . Good. Comer, comer  means to eat . So how do you say I eat or I’m eating ?  
S: Como.   
T: Como . Good. I’m going to eat:   
S: Voy a comer.   
T: Good.  Voy a comer.  The word for late in Spanish is tarde . Tarde . We know this from English as 
well because we have this slang in English, in British English at least, tardy . Have you ever heard 
that?  
S: Yes.  
T: Tarde.  Tarde.  So how would you say I’m going to eat late ?  
S: Voy a comer tarde.   
T: Good. Voy a comer tarde . You might have heard the word for tomorrow  as well in Spanish.  
Mañana . So how would you say I’m going to eat tomorrow ?  
S: Voy a comer mañana.   
T: Voy a comer mañana.  Now in Spanish, if yo u have some kind of future context, something that’s 
showing you that you’re talking about the future, you can just use the present. You can say Voy a 
comer mañana  or you could just say I eat tomorrow  because you have tomorrow  showing you 
that you’re talki ng about the future. It’s absolutely perfect Spanish, even though it sounds a bit odd 
in English. It’s perfect Spanish to say I eat tomorrow . There’s no problem there. So how would 
you say that?  
S: Como mañana.   
T: Como mañana.  So if you want to say I’m e ating with Pablo tomorrow . I’m eating with Pablo 
tomorrow . You just say I eat with Pablo tomorrow .  
S: How do you say with?  
T: Do you remember how to say to confirm ?  
S: Confirmación -confirmar .T: Good. And what did that mean literally? Confirm ?  
S: Ah! “With signature ”.  
T: So what is with?  
S: Con firma . Con.  
T: Con.  Good. So, I’m eating with Pablo tomorrow:   
S: Como con Pablo mañana.   
T: Good. Como con Pablo mañana.  So we can just use the present or we can say I’m going to eat 
with Pablo tom orrow  and it’s the same.  
S: Voy a comer con Pablo mañana.   
T: Good.  Voy a comer con Pablo mañana.  Very good. So we are taking off our ending. We’re taking 
off our -ar, -er or -ir and we’re adding -o to get the “I”  version. We are also accenting the 
penult imate syllable. The syllable that comes before the last. What is to organize ?  
S: Organización -Organizar .  
T: Good. Now how do you say I organize  or I’m organizing ?  
S: Organizo ?  
T: Organizo.  Good. I will just mention for anybody trying to keep up with th e Spanish pronunciation 
that that z there is going to be pronounced /th/. /Organitho / in Spain. Organizo . To have  in Spanish 
is tener . Tener.   
S: Tener.   
T: Tener.  How do you say I want to have it? I want to have it:   
S: Quiero tenerlo.   
T: Good. I’m going to have it:   
S: Voy a tenerlo.   
T: Good. I’m going to have it late:S: Voy a tenerlo tarde.   
T: Good! Voy a tenerlo tarde.  If you want to say later , you can say more  late and the word for more  
is más, m-a-s.  
S: Más.   
T: Related to massive . So h ow is later ?  
S: Más tarde.   
T: Más tarde.  Good. I’m going to have it later:   
S: Voy a tenerlo mas tarde.   
T: Good. I will tell you something that’s going to help you remember tener . Tener  is a very 
interesting verb, because other than to have , we can also  translate it as -tain. Contain  is contener . 
Obtain , this -tain is tener . So how would you say obtain  in Spanish, if contain  becomes contener ?  
S: Obtener.   
T: Yes! Obtener.  Sustain , this one changes a little bit. Sus-, which is s-u-s, becomes s-o-s in Spa nish.  
S: Sostener.   
T: Sostener . Sustain. Maintain. Maintain , this main  becomes man - in Spanish. So how would you 
say maintain ?  
S: Mantener.   
T: Mantener.  And if you heard entretener , what would you think it means? Entretener:   
S: Entertain.   
T: Yes. So it changes a little bit, but you can recognize it. Entretener . And entre  in Spanish means 
between . You might hear in Spanish entre tu y yo . Between you and I . Entre tu y yo . Many 
languages express this idea of possession in different ways. In English  and in Spanish, we have a 
simple verb: Have , tener , to express possession. But Arabic for example, you would say “at me” 
or “with me” instead of “I have.” So it’s not a straightforward concept that all languages express 
in the same way, this concept of po ssession. In Turkish, for example, if you want to say “I have acar” you say “My car there is.” So it’s not such a straightforward concept that we are expressing 
in all languages in the same way, this concept of possession. Something that Spanish is alludi ng 
to here is kind of the symbiotic relationship in ownership. When you own something, you also 
belong to it. You must maintain it. You must sustain it. You must contain it. It’s a symbiotic 
relationship. You don’t just own things. You are also owned by th em. To have  is tener . And you 
also get these other verbs that you can use. Obtener , contener , mantener , sostener , entretener .  
I have  is tengo . What happened here? What should it be?  
S: Teno.   
T: Yes. That’s what it should be. But it’s irregular. It has a  g popping up. But the nice thing about the 
irregular verbs in Spanish is that we can group them together. There’s always a little group of verbs 
that do thing s in the same way. For example, what was to come ?  
S: Venir.   
T: Venir. Very good. Now venir  behaves like tener  when it makes the I form. So if tener  becomes 
tengo , venir  might become…  
S: Vengo.   
T: Vengo ! Good. So I come  is vengo . It’s irregular. But we’ve already noticed two verbs that have 
this same pattern of irregularity. And to think of them together helps us. Now if you want to say I  
will come tomorrow , we don’t know the word for will, but we don’t need it. Because tomorrow  is 
our future context. What is the word for tomorrow ?  
S: Mañana .  
T: Good. So I’m coming tomorrow:   
S: Vengo  mañana.   
T: Vengo  mañana.  Very good.
