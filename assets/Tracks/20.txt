Track 20  
T: We mentioned that with future co ntext we can talk about the future using the present. For example, 
we had tomorrow  which was:  
S: Mañana.   
T: Mañana. Good. We had later , or more late , which was:  
S: Más tarde.   
T: Más tarde. We had tonight , or this night :  
S: Esta noche.   
T: Esta noche. Good. Another one is pronto . What do you think pronto  means?  
S: Now.   
T: Ahora  was now, no?  
S: Soon ?  
T: Soon . Yeah. You hear in English sometimes get here pronto . It's get here soon . So pronto  is also 
future context. What was the verb to see , or to view ?  
S: Ver.  
T: He sees :  
S: Ve.  
T: Good. They :  
S: Ven.   
T: You (informal):  
S: Ves.  
T: We:  
S: Vemos.T: Very good. The I version is a tiny bit irregular, it's veo. So you have v-e-o. So it's not vo as it 
should be, or / bo/. It was too short; it became  veo.  
S: Veo.   
T: V-e-o. /beo/ or / veo/. How how would you say: I’m seeing her later ?  
S: Veo ella más tarde.   
T: That means I see she later .  
S: It's not la?  
T: It is.  
S: Oh so it's la veo .  
T: La veo. Good.  
S: La veo más tarde.   
T: La veo más ta rde. I'm seeing her tonight :  
S: La veo esta noche.   
T: Good. La veo esta noche. We are seeing her soon .  We are seeing her soon :  
S: La venemos pronto.   
T: What is: to see ?  
S: Sorry it should be vemos ?  
T: Yes. So no guessing. No guessing at all. It's th e only rule.  
S: La vemos pronto.   
T: Good. La vemos pronto. What if we say we're seeing, we will see, them soon  but with this them  
we mean a female group? We're seeing them soon :  
S: Las vemos pronto.T: Good. Las vemos pronto. He is seeing them soon.  And this them,  they are still females. He is 
seeing them soon:   
S: Las ve pronto.   
T: Good. And you (informal):  
S: La ves pronto.   
T: Them  soon. You're seeing them :  
S: Las ves pronto.   
T: Good. I'll make it a question: are you seeing them soon?  The female them .  
S: ¿Las ves pronto?   
T: ¿Las ves pronto? Aren't you seeing them soon? :  
S: ¿No las ves pronto?   
T: ¿No las ves pronto? Why aren't you seeing them soon? :  
S: ¿Por qué no las ves pronto?   
T: Good. ¿Por qué no las ves pronto? Very good. So we saw that  with future context, we don't need 
the future. If we don't have future context, we can still use the present to talk about the future using 
this I go or I'm going , which is present, but we can use it to talk about the future in Spanish as we 
do in English . I'm going to see her , and you're talking about the future. We're going to see her . So 
let's practice that - how would you say: we're going to see her ?  
S: Vamos a verla.   
T: Are you going to see him soon?  Speaking informally. Are you going to see him soo n? So you can't 
work with ir, which is to go . You should probably work with vamos  and work backwards.  
S: Vas. ¿Vas a verlo pronto ?  
T: Good. ¿Vas a verlo pronto ? The word for us is nos. Nos. So how would you say are you going to 
see us soon?  Are you going to see us soon?  And we're still speaking informally.S: ¿Vas a ver nos pronto?   
T: Very good. ¿Vas a vernos pronto?  Where else could that nos go?  
S: At the beginning.  
T: Before the changed verb.  
S: ¿Nos vas a ver pronto?   
T: Very good. ¿Nos vas a ver pronto? Aren't you going to see us soon?   
S: ¿No vas a ver pronto - nos pronto?   
T: Good. ¿No vas a vernos pronto?   Or ¿No nos vas a ver pronto?  Either way. Why aren't you 
going to see us soon?   
S: ¿Por qué no vas a ver nos pronto?   
T: Good. So we've seen that we can use the present to talk about the future using “going to ”, or also 
using future context. A word like tomorrow , next week ; next week is “the week that comes". And 
the week  is la semana . La semana. How would you say the w eek that comes ? So what is the word 
for that, which is the same as what ?  
S: Que.   
T: Que. La semana que , the week that, the week which, comes . And here we mean the week comes . 
So it's it comes . So what is: it comes ?  
S: Vene. Viene.   
T: Good. So next week is la semana que viene . The week that comes . La semana que viene.  So you 
could say let's speak , and to say let's speak  we know from vamos  you can just use the “we” form. 
So to speak  is:  
S: Hablar.   
T: Hablar. We speak :  
S: Hablamos.T: Let's speak next week . Let's speak the week that comes.   
S: Hablamos la semana que - And now I've forgotten come .  
T: It's okay. Okay. If we forgot it, we need to find it again. That's not any problem. Every time we do 
find it, we strengthen that process. And that's wh at we need, not to remember the word. The process 
we need to strengthen. I want you to know how to find to come  and then to go from there. It comes . 
Take your time to find it comes .  
S: Vene.   
T: It would be vene  but:  
S: Viene.   
T: Let's speak the coming week :  
S: Hablamos que -  
T: At the moment you have the whole sentence in your mind and you want to translate it. Now this 
process works when you're memorizing. But we're not memorizing. We're doing something else; 
we're building. So we must reduce it down to the smallest piece we could possibly think about, 
think about that piece, get it out, and then forget it. So the first bit is we speak/let's speak :  
S: Hablamos.   
T: The week :  
S: La semana.   
T: Which , or that, comes .  
S: Que vene - viene .  
T: Viene. Good. Hablamos la semana que viene. What was to see , or to view ?  
S: Ver.  
T: Ver. What is we see ?  
S: Vemos.T: Vemos. If you want to say we see each other , you say we see us . Nos can mean us, ourselves, each 
other , it can mean all of that. Nos. So how do  you say: we see ourselves ?  
S: Nos vemos.   
T: Nos vemos. This is a way of saying goodbye in Spanish. Nos vemos , we see each other . Now the 
future context here is the fact that you're saying goodbye. But we're using present because we 
know when we say nos vemos  we don't mean we're seeing each other right now, we mean we will 
see each other again . We're not even mentioning that future context, but it's working. It's allowing 
us to use the present there. Nos vemos, ciao . Or you might want to say, we w ill see each other next 
week . How would you say that? So piece by piece. We see each other.  I want all of your mental 
energy on that, and not thinking yet about next week , how you will say that. What you're worried 
about right now in this moment is how you 're going to say we see ourselves . And even before that, 
just we see:   
S: So it's vemos . And it's nos vemos .  
T: Good. The week that comes . So the week :  
S: La semana que viene.   
T: Good. Nos vemos la semana que viene.  So you see it's not important to reme mber viene . We don't 
want to remember viene , this is useless. In fact, if we memorize viene , we're just going to be 
glazing over the problem. What we want to internalize is the process of “how do I find this". So, 
we've seen that we can use the present to talk about the future using either ir a: to go to ; voy a, 
vamos a, va a ; or using some future context.
