Track 39  
T: What was the word for with in Spanish? And we have it in words like convenient , confirm  -  
S: Oh, con.  
T: So con is with and we have it as like a Latin building block in many Latin/English words. 
Consequence: with sequence . Now in Spanish you do n’t say with her, with him, with them , you 
actually just say with he, with she, with they . So how would you say with him or with he ?  
S: Con él.   
T: Con él . With her :  
S: Con ella .  
T: Con ella . With them :  
S: Con ellos.   
T: Or, I mean if it was feminine :  
S: Oh, ellas.  
T: Yeah, con ellas . With us :  
S: Nos.  
T: Nos is us, but of course in Spanish we won’t say with us , we will say with we .  
S: Con nosotros .  
T: Yes, con nosotros . What if you were an all female group?  
S: Con nosotras .  
T: Con nosotras . Good. With you , speaking formally?  
S: Con usted .  
T: Con usted . And with you guys :  
S: Con ustedes .T: Con ustedes . The word for for is para . So how would you say for him ?  
S: Para él .  
T: Para él . Good. So when you decided that it was para él , you put para and con in the same group.  
And they are in the same group. They’re in a group of words which are called prepositions. Now 
prepositions show some kind of movement or position; and they’re very important and interesting 
words so it’s useful for us t o identify them as we did with verbs and adjectives and nouns. So we 
are going to investigate now a little more about prepositions and how they behave in Spanish. So 
for him , para él . For her :  
S: Para ella .  
T: Para ella . Good. For them :  
S: Para ellos .  
T: Or?  
S: Para ellas .  
T: Good. And for us :  
S: Para nosotros .  
T: Para nosotros . Or?  
S: Nosotras .  
T: Good. Para nosotras  if it’s an all feminine group. Good. Like I said, we don’t say for him , but for 
he and we don’t say for her , but for she , with the exception of me and you informal, we get two 
different versions of the words for me and you. So for me  is para mí. Para mí. And you informal 
becomes ti. So for you , speaking informally, is para ti . So this is just after prepositions we get this 
mí and ti. M-i and t-i. So we can find another preposition that we learned already. The word for of 
or from . So again this is a small word which is showing movement, direction or position ; these are 
prepositions. So what was of or from ?  
S: De.T: De. Good. So how would you say from him ?  
S: De él .  
T: Good. De él . From her :  
S: De ella .  
T: De ella . From me :  
S: De mí.  
T: Yes. De mí, spelled m-i. From you  speaking informally?  
S: De ti.   
T: De ti . Good. From them :  
S: De ellos .  
T: De ellos .  
S: Or ellas.  
T: Or ellas. Good. De ellas . From us :  
S: De nosotros .  
T: De nosotros . Good. From you guys :  
S: De ustedes .  
T: Good. Is it- Is it from you guys? :  
S: ¿Es de ustedes ?  
T: Good. Is it from you guys?  ¿Es de ustedes ? How would you say it’s for you guys ?  
S: Es para ustedes .  
T: Good. Es para ustedes . Good. How do you say it is with you guys ?  
S: Es con ustedes .T: Now something to me doesn’t feel right here. When we say es de ustedes , it’s from you guys  and 
es para ustedes , it’s for you guys : we are speaking about things are quite characteristic of whatever 
this thing is, whatever this it is. It’s for you guys. It’s from you guys.  But, when we say it’s with 
you guys , we are speaking about a state because we are speaking about the location of so mething. 
So how do you think it would be - it is with you guys ?  
S: Está con ustedes .  
T: Very good. Está con ustedes . Very good. To do or to make was hacer . H-a-c-e-r.  
S: Hacer .  
T: Hacer . So how do you say he does or he’s doing or he makes or he’s ma king:  
S: Ha.  
T: This is from haber , but well thought out. [Laughter]  
S: So it’s hace .  
T: Hace . Good. A favor  is un favor . Un favor . So how would you say he’s doing me a favor ? He’s 
doing me a favor :  
S: Me hace un favor .  
T: Good. Me hace un fav or. Good. How do you say he’s doing her a favor ?  
S: La hace un favor .  
T: Now if you say la hace , it sounds like he’s making it  - a feminine thing. If you want to say he’s 
doing her a favor, for her . So what does la turn to to become to her, for her ?  
S: Le hace un favor .  
T: Good. Le hace un favor . Good. Decir  is to tell . No? So we have hablar  to speak or to talk  and 
decir  is to say or to tell . D-e-c-i-r. So / dethir / in most of Spain . Decir . So how do you say I want 
to tell, I want to say ? I want, just think of I want.   
S: Quiero .  
T: To say or to tell :S: Decir .  
T: Ah, all together.  
S: Quiero decir .  
T: Quiero decir . Ah. I want to tell him. I want to tell him :  
S: Le quiero decir .  
T: Le quiero decir  or?  
S: Quiero decirle .  
T: Good. You ha ve the option there of where you can put the le, before the changed verb or after the 
complete verb. Le quiero decir. Quiero decirle . But if you want to say, I want to say it :  
S: Lo quiero decir .  
T: Lo quiero decir . So we see actually with this le, we ar e kind of replacing a preposition with le and 
les, an imaginary preposition : to, for, from . For example, comprar . Comprar  means to buy . I can 
say I buy you something.  Now this you is actually replacing for you . I buy something for you . So 
what is I buy  from comprar ?  
S: Compro .  
T: Compro . How do you say I buy them  and you refer to the things that you are buying?  
S: Los compro .  
T: Los compro . But, if you say I buy them and you mean I buy for them :  
S: Les compro .  
T: Les compro . So this is the most natu ral Spanish structure. Les compro . You use les instead of for 
them . But, you could say I buy for them . You could do that if you wanted to, using for them  literally. 
So how would you say I buy or I’m buying for them ?  
S: Compro para ellos .T: Compro para  ellos . Good. So in an everyday situation, I’m buying something for them , les 
compro . Mostly we are going to be avoiding these prepositions, so he buys it for me . I’m just 
going to say he buys me it  rather than he buys it for me . So how would you say that?  He buys me 
it:  
S: Me compra. Me lo compra .  
T: Me lo compra . They buy me it or they buy it for me :  
S: Me lo compran .  
T: Good. Me lo compran . They buy them for me. They buy them for me :  
S: Me los compran .  
T: Good. Me los compran . Good. Now, we said th at these small words me, nos, te, le, les, most of 
the time what we are replacing with them is to, but sometimes it’s like for, like to do a favor for , 
but they also might be replacing other prepositions like de. For example, if I want to say he buys 
it from me , I don’t really need the from  there either. I could just say he buys me it . So how would 
I say that? He buys it from me. He buys me it :  
S: Me lo compra .  
T: Me lo compra . So this is totally ambiguous. No? It could mean he buys it for me  or he buys i t from 
me, but it’s something that we’ll understand from the context. So the key point to take away from 
here is that we probably use prepositions much more in English than in Spanish and you just want 
to kind of like listen out for this and then you will start shedding them. You  will start shedding 
your prepositions the more you listen to Spanish.
