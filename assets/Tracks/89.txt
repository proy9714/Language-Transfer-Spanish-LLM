Track 89  
T: So in the spirit of looking at irregularities in Spanish and how to deal with them and how to identify 
them, I wanted to spend a little bit of time speaking about making your own rules. We’ve taught 
you a great amount of Spanish for you to be very conversational and reach fluency just through 
practice and listening in a very short amount of time , if you get practicing. But we haven’t looked 
at every single piece of content of Spanish, of course, but the content that we’ve looked at has 
taken from every area of the language in an analytical way which will allow you to make your own 
rules when you come across things that you don’t quite understand whilst you’re practicing and 
exposing yourself to Spanish. So I just want to experiment a little bit in regards to that with you 
now. So I will present you with some imaginary situations where you see the language behaving 
in certain ways and I want you to make your own rule. Now it doesn’t mean it’s necessarily your 
own. Somebody else might have come up with it before, but that you will figure out for yourself 
what is going on. So for example, the word for  too, as in t-o-o is demasiado .  
Demasiado .  
S: Demasiado .  
T: It is a bit of a long word, but if you break it up it’s easier to digest. You have de más, of more , -iado. 
And this is too, t-o-o, as in too many. Actually de más  can be used by itself if y ou say tengo 
cuatro de más . I have four of more , tengo cuatro de más . It means I have four too many . I have 
four spare. I have four extra . So demasiado  means too. Now imagine you hear these following 
sentences and I want you to work out what’s happening he re. Why this word is behaving differently 
in different circumstances. So you might hear demasiadas casas . You might hear demasiados 
coches . And you might hear demasiado agresivo , demasiado agresiva , and demasiado 
agresivos . Again. You might hear demasiadas  casas , demasiados coches . Here it’s changing 
from the base form demasiado . Demasiadas casas. Demasiados coches. And then here it’s not. 
Demasiado agresivo. Demasiado agresiva. Demasiado agresivos.  So why in one situation is it 
changing and why in the othe r situation is it not?  
S: The only difference I see is that it’s related to nouns in the first two examples and in the second 
two it’s related to something descriptive.T: Adjectives.  
S: Adjectives.  
T: Espectacular . Well done. Brilliant. That’s it. We said that identifying what type of word we have 
will mostly be all we need to do to figure out what’s going on. So we understand from this that 
when demasiado  goes with a noun, it will change to match it: demasiadas casas , demasiados 
coches . But when it go es with an adjective it won’t: demasiado agresivo , demasiado agresiva , 
demasiado agresivos , demasiado agresivas . It’s not changing. So we didn’t learn that here, but 
we have been analytical enough of the language for you to figure that out by yourself. So another 
example for you to figure out what’s going on. Now the words ala, wing , agua , water  and aula, 
hole or classroom  are all feminine words, but we say el ala , the wing . El agua , the water . And el 
aula, the classroom . What’s going on?  
S: Is it because the first letter of those words is a, and it would be weird to say “la ala”.  
T: You have other words that begin with a where you have la at the beginning, for example la 
alfombra , the carpet . La almohada , the pillow . So you need to find something that’s d ifferent 
between la almohada and la alfombra to el agua , el ala , el aula .  
S: Well, the difference in this case is that it’s just two, just two syllables, perhaps.  
T: That’s it. There are two syllables and they begin and end in a. So it’s a very specifi c thing. It’s not 
something that we are really going to spend time on learning here in this course. Because it’s very 
likely as well that you’ll forget it. So what we have done throughout this course is given you the 
analytical skills to work it  out by yourself and the confidence to make your own rules. So that’s 
the rule. They are all feminine words, but they take el becuase they are two syllables and they 
begin and end with a. And we know that they are feminine because we say el agua fria . The cold 
water . Fria, not frio. So we know they are actually feminine even though they are taking el. One 
more exercise like this. The word for one is uno. The word for some  is alguno . And the word for 
none  is ninguno . So we have uno, alguno , ninguno . One, some , none . So if I tell you how many 
do you want , you will reply to me uno. Or if you don’t want any, ninguno . But if I say one man , 
how do I say one man or a man ?  
S: Un hombre.T: Un hombre . And if I say some man , I say algun hombre . And if I sa y no man , I say ningun 
hombre . So we have uno, alguno  and ninguno . No quiero ninguno, quiero uno, quiero alguno . 
But, if I say I want one car , for example. Quiero un coche. Quiero algun coche. No quiero 
ningun coche . So what’s happening there? Why does uno become un and why does alguno  
become algun ?  
S: Because a noun is following.  
T: Yes, because we have a noun following it and it loses that last o. So uno, alguno , ninguno , become 
un, algun , ningun . And you would notice that it doesn’t happen with the  feminine. So we have 
una mujer , a woman . Alguna mujer , some woman . Ninguna mujer , no woman . So the point is 
just this, that we need to analyze the language that we are coming across, trying to pick out 
anything that we don’t understand to tackle it so tha t we control it and we understand what’s 
happening so that that element of the language doesn’t control us. Very quickly, thinking in this 
way you will get over your technical problems in the language. You will solve your technical 
problems and then when y ou solve your technical problems in a specific language, then you can 
start to live freely in that language. And become somebody else in that language that is also you, 
but somebody else, because you are using this mechanism or this tool which as we’ve said a few 
times, permits and obliges you to perceive and express the world in a certain way. But before we 
can fully take advantage of that, we want to get over our technical difficulties and this is achieved 
not through memorizing what is correc t, but analyzing and understanding what is correct and 
finding why.
