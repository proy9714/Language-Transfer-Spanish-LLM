Track 65  
T: What was the word for nothing ?  
S: Nada .  
T: Nada . And nobody :  
S: Nadie .  
T: Yes, nadie.  What was the word for more,  like in “more late” or later?   
S: Más.  
T: Más.  
S: Más tarde .  
T: Good. So if you add más to nada  or nadie  you get else. So más can also mean else, like nadie 
más.  
What does that mean? Nadie más :  
S: Nobody else.   
T: Nobody else.  Nada más:   
S: Nothing else.   
T: Nothing else.  Good. So how would you say I didn’t eat anything else ? I didn’t eat anything else :  
S: No comí  - anything?   
T: So we have double negative. So we’ll say I didn’t eat  nothing else, nothing more :  
S: No comí nada más .  
T: Good. No comí nada más . I didn’t eat anything else . Good. Didn’t you eat anything else?   
(speaking informally) Didn’t you eat anything else? :  
S: I forgot the informal for past.T: You have the s in there which relates to you informal. And you also have the t in there,  
S: Ah, comiste.   
T: Good. Which also relates to you informal, that t, but in a different way. But they’re both in there 
and they will help you remember that ending, comiste.  Didn’t you eat anything else? :  
S: ¿No comiste nada más ?  
T: Good. ¿ No comiste nada más ? What was to see ?  
S: Ver.  
T: Ver. I saw :  
S: “Verí.” Yeah, sorry, vi.  
T: Vi. Good. You got the ending right. He saw :  
S: Vio.  
T: Vio. Good. You saw  (speaking informally):  
S: Viste .  
T: Viste . We saw :  
S: Vimos .  
T: Vimos . And they saw :  
S: Vieron .  
T: Vieron .  
S: The accent’s on the /e/.  
T: Yes, vieron.  So that’s our set. Vi, vio, vimos, viste, vieron . Good. Didn’t you see me last night?   
(speaking informally) Didn’t you se e me last night? :  
S: ¿No me viste anoche ?T: Good. ¿ No me viste anoche ? Time  in the sense of occasion, no? - like when we say once  we mean 
one time . Or when we say again  we mean another time - is vez. Vez. V-e-z. So in Spain this would 
sound like / bes/. Vez.  
S: Vez.  
T: This is a feminine word, so how would you say one time or once ?  
S: Una vez .  
T: Una vez . So how would you say I saw him once ?  
S: Lo vi una vez .  
T: Good. Lo vi una vez . Good. How would you say I saw them once ?  
S: Los vi una v ez.  
T: Good. Los vi una vez . They saw them once :  
S: Los vieron una vez.  
T: Good. Los vieron una vez . How do you think you would say one more time , one more time , how 
do you think you would say that?  
S: Una vez más.  
T: Yes, una vez más . Good. So you co uld say something like I want to see them one more time. I 
want to see them one more time.  How would you say that?  
S: Quiero verlos una vez más.  
T: Good. Quiero verlos una vez más . I want to see them one more time. Once more.  What was the 
word for we? The word for we:  
S: Nosotros .  
T: Nosotros . Good. Now nosotros  is actually the combination of nos, like how we have in us, and 
otros  which means others.  So we is kind of like us others . How would you say another time ? And 
you don’t say an other time in Span ish, you just say other time . So you don’t need an. So another 
time:S: Otra vez.  
T: Otra vez . Good. We can take this otros , we can work backwards to get otra,  otra vez . So you can 
use this like again.  Otra vez . Another time . So you could say I want to s ee them again. I want to 
see them again :  
S: Quiero verlos otra vez.  
T: Good. Quiero verlos otra vez . What was to leave or to go out ?  
S: Salir .  
T: Salir . Good. And what was to dance , related to ballerina?   
S: Bailar .  
T: Bailar . So how would you ask i nformally, did you go out to dance again?  Did you go out to dance 
again  (speaking informally) ?  
S: ¿Saliste a bailar otra vez?  
T: Very good. Saliste a , because we have this verb of motion of coming and going. ¿ Saliste a bailar 
otra vez ? Good. What was to speak ?  
S: Hablar .  
T: Hablar . And I spoke :  
S: Hablé .  
T: Hablé . He spoke, she spoke, it spoke, you  (formal) spoke :  
S: Habló   
T: Habló . We spoke :  
S: Hablamos .  
T: Hablamos . You (informal):  
S: Hablaste .  
T: Hablaste . And they:S: Hablaron .  
T: Hablar on. Well done. To arrive, to arrive  was llegar .  
S: Llegar .  
T: Llegar . How would you say you arrived , informally?  
S: Llegaste .  
T: Llegaste.  Did you arrive late again? Did you arrive late again? :  
S: So ¿ Llegaste tarde otra vez ?  
T: Good. ¿ Llegaste tarde  otra vez ? Did you arrive late again?  Good. What was my house ?  
S: Mi casa.  
T: Mi casa . How would you say he arrived late to my house again ? So he arrived late to my house 
again :  
S: Llegó tarde a mi casa otra vez .  
T: Good. Llegó tarde a mi casa otra  vez. Or llegó a mi casa tarde otra vez . This is ah, flexible. 
How would you say he arrived at my house again, wanting to speak with me. He arrived at my 
house, to my house, again, wanting to speak with me :  
S: Llegó a mi casa otra vez,  
T: Very good. Want ing:  
S: Is it querer,  to want ?  
T: Yes.  
S: So, queriendo.  Queriendo hablar conmigo.  
T: Good. Llegó a mi casa otra vez queriendo hablar conmigo . So we saw that we don’t use the -ing 
in Spanish nearly half as much as we do in English. In English we really  overuse the -ing, but this 
is one situation where we do want it, in structures like this. He arrived at my house again, wantingto speak with me . Llegó a mi casa otra vez queriendo hablar conmigo . Good. So my house is 
mi casa , your house , speaking informa lly, is tu casa . Tu casa.  
S: Tu casa.  
T: You might have heard the expression mi casa es tu casa . What does that mean?  
S: My house is your house.   
T: If you want to say at what time , you say at what hour . How would that be?  
S: ¿A qué hora ?  
T: Hora . Her e we use hora.  ¿A qué hora ? Good. So how would you say at what time did they arrive 
at your house? To your house? At what time did they arrive at your house? :  
S: ¿A qué hora llegaron a tu casa ?  
T: Good. ¿ A qué hora llegaron a tu casa ? Very good. At what time did they arrive at your house or 
to your house?  Good. If you say a la vez , a la vez , it means at the same time , like in English when 
we say at a time . A la vez . Two at a time , we can say in English. This is at the time , at the same 
time. A la vez . So you might want to say everybody arrived at my house at the same time .  
What was the word for all?  
S: Todo .  
T: Todo . Good. If you make this plural, todos,  you get everybody.  Everybody,  or you might also hear 
in Spanish todo el mundo . “All the world” to say everybody,  but todos  is very common. So 
everybody arrived at my house at the same time :  
S: Todos llegaron a mi casa a la vez .  
T: Good. Todos llegaron a mi casa a la vez . Todos llegaron a la vez a mi casa . Flexible. What was 
to find or to encounter ?  
S: Encontrar .  
T: Encontrar . And I found :  
S: Encontré .T: Encontré . I didn’t find anything else in your house . What was your house  again?  
S: Tu casa.  
T: Tu casa . Good. I didn’t find anything else, nothing more, in your house.  I didn’t find anything e lse 
in your house :  
S: No encontré nada más en tu casa.  
T: Good. I didn’t find anything else in your house.  No encontré nada más en tu casa . Good. So we 
have mi casa, tu casa . Now the word for our is nuestro.  Our house is nuestra casa . Nuestra 
casa. We ca n see the o splitting of  nosotros  there in nuestro,  nuestra.  So that’s our. So how 
would you say did you visit our house?  What is to visit ? Visitation :  
S: Visitación . Visitar.  
T: Good. So did you visit our house , speaking informally:  
S: ¿Visitaste nuestra casa ?  
T: Good. ¿Visitaste nuestra casa ? Did you visit our house?  How would you say we are with our 
friends  - how do you think you would say that, we are with our friends ? We are with , what to be 
do you think we will use?  
S: Estar .  
T: Estar  because we are with , location. Good. So we are with our friends :  
S: Estamos con nuestros amigos.  
T: Good. Nuestros amigos . Good , you make it plural to match amigos.  We are with our friends.   
What if we meant all female friends?  
S: Estamos con nue stras amigas .  
T: Good. Estamos con nuestras amigas . How would you say I am with my friends ? I am with my 
friends :  
S: Estoy con , is it mis amigos ?T: Yes. Estoy con mis amigos . So the words for possession, mi, tu, nuestro  can change for number 
to match  the number: mi amigo , mis amigos . And if it ends in -o like nuestro,  it can change for 
gender as well. Nuestro amigo, nuestra amiga . So we have mi/my, tu/your,  nuestro  or 
nuestra /our. For his/her/their/your  (speaking formally), for all of that, we have th e same word 
which is su. Su. S-u.  
S: Su.  
T: Su. So how would you say I want to go to his house ? I want to go to his house :  
S: Quiero ir a su casa .  
T: Good. Quiero ir a su casa . I want to go to his house.  How would you say I want to go to their 
house ?  
S: Quiero ir a su casa .  
T: Good. Quiero ir a su casa . So it’s the same. If you put it in plural or not refers to the things that 
are possessed, not the possessors. So avoid any temptation to say sus, because you mean they.  You 
are only going to say sus if you are saying houses,  for example. So if you were to say I want to go 
to their houses , there you can put it in plural. How would that be?  
S: Quiero ir a sus casas.   
T: Good. Quiero ir a sus casas . And I want to go to his houses, I want to go to his  houses :  
S: Quiero ir a sus casas .  
T: Exactly. The same. Quiero ir a sus casas . So these possessive words mi, tu, nuestro , su, they 
refer to the thing being possessed, rather than the possessor when they’re changing. If you want to 
say my own house , if you want to say my own house or my very own house , you can say mi propia 
casa. Like property . Mi propia casa.  
S: Mi propia casa .  
T: Good. How would you say my own car ?  
S: Mi propio auto .T: Good. Mi propio auto . The word for eye in Spanish - not I as in your, eye as in the two things in 
your head, is ojo. Ojo. O-j-o. Ojo.  
S: Ojo.  
T: Ojo. How would you say my own eyes, my own eyes ?  
S: Mi propios ojos .  
T: There ’s some kind of disagreements going on in there.  
S: Mis. Mis propios ojos .  
T: Good.  So, I saw it with my own eyes. I saw it with my own eyes :  
S: Lo vi con mis propios ojos .  
T: Good. Lo vi con mis propios ojos . Very good. How would you say I want to live in my own house ? 
I want to live in my own house :  
S: Quiero vivir en mi propio ca sa, mi propia casa .  
T: Good. Quiero vivir en mi propia casa . Good. I want to live in my own house . Good.
