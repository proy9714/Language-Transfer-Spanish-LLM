T: What was to do or to make  in Spanish?  
S: Hacer .  
T: Hacer . Good. How would you say it does or it makes ?  
S: Hace .  
T: Hace . Good. Now hace,  you can use like ago. Like in English when you say two weeks ago , you 
can say it makes two weeks  in Spanish, and you get that meanin g. So week  is semana.  Two is - do 
you remember two?   
S: Dos.  
T: Dos. So two weeks ago , you will say it makes two weeks :  
S: Hace dos semanas.  
T: Hace dos semanas . I saw him two weeks ago :  
S: Lo vi hace dos semanas.  
T: Good. Lo vi hace dos semanas . Good. To respond is responder.  Responder . How would you say 
I responded ?  
S: Respondí .  
T: Respondí . How would you say I responded to her ?  
S: La respondí . Le. Le respondí.  
T: Good. Le respondí . I responded to her. I responded to her seven weeks a go. Do you remember 
how to say seven?  Related to September :  
S: Siete .  
T: Siete . Good. So I responded to her seven weeks ago :  
S: Le respondí hace siete semanas.T: Good. Le respondí hace siete semanas.  Now in Spanish, you can say I responded her it.  For 
example, I responded to her letter or I responded to her mail . Instead of saying it this way, to her 
mail, in Spanish you can just say I responded him the mail . I responded her the mail . Or if you 
know what you are talking about, I responded him it. I r esponded her it . This is because, and 
something we’ll look at again later, Spanish does not use possessive words as much as English 
does. So, it would be much more natural in Spanish, I responded her the mail . I responded him the 
mail, instead of I respond ed to her mail . So how would you say I responded her it , which isn’t 
great English, but it’s perfect Spanish ?  
S: Se lo respondí.  
T: Good. Se lo respondí . So the se is actually le, to her . The lo is el mail and you get se lo respondí . 
I responded to he r the mail . Good. Month  is mes.  Mes. M-e-s.  
S: Mes.  
T: It’s a masculine word, so how would you say the month ?  
S: El mes.  
T: Good, and how would you say a month or one month ?  
S: Un mes.  
T: Un mes . So un mes can be a month or one month . So how wou ld you say I responded it to her one 
month ago ? I responded to her mail, I responded her it one month ago :  
S: Se lo respondí hace un mes.  
T: Good. Se lo respondí hace un mes . Good. So we have respondí . I responded . How would you 
say he, she, it, you (formal) responded ?  
S: Respondió .  
T: Good. Respondió . And we responded :  
S: Respondimos .  
T: Good. Respondimos . So respondí,  respondió,  respondimos.  Let’s make a quick recap with an -ar 
verb. How would you say discrimination ?S: Descriminación .  
T: Ag ain?  
S: Descriminación .  
T: In English we say discrimination  or descrimination?   
S: Oh, it’s with an i, yeah.  
T: It’s with an i, right?  
S: Yeah, discriminación .  
T: Discriminación . To discriminate :  
S: Discriminar .  
T: Discriminar . I discriminated :  
S: Discriminé .  
T: Discriminé . He, or she, or it, you (formal)  discriminated :  
S: Discriminó .  
T: Good. And we discriminated :  
S: Discriminamos .  
T: Good. So we have two more people to learn for the point in the past. They  and you informal. Let’s 
begin with you informal. For you informal, in the point in the past we have -aste for -ar verbs and 
-iste for -er/-ir verbs. -aste for -ar verbs and -iste for -er/-ir verbs. So how would you say you 
spoke , speaking informally?  
S: Hablaste .  
T: Hablaste . And you ate , speaking informally:  
S: Comiste .  
T: Good. Comiste . Did you eat? :S: ¿Comiste ?  
T: ¿Comiste ? Didn’t you eat? :  
S: ¿No comiste ?  
T: ¿No comiste ? Didn’t you eat it? :  
S: ¿No lo comiste?   
T: ¿No lo comiste ? Good. What was to leave or to go out ?  
S: Salir .  
T: Salir . How would you say did you go out? Did you leave? :  
S: ¿Saliste ?  
T: ¿Saliste ? Good. You didn’t go out last night? Last night  is anoche.  Anoche .  
S: Anoche .  
T: Now if you translate tonight  directly, what you will come up with is anoche.  So you must be 
careful not to get confused here. How do you say tonight  in Spanish?  
S: Esta noche.  
T: Esta noche . “This night”. So anoche  is last night , not tonight . So how would you say did you go 
out last night ( speaking informally )?  
S: ¿Saliste anoche ?  
T: Good. ¿ Saliste anoche ? Didn’t you go out last night? :  
S: ¿No saliste anoche ?  
T: Good. ¿ No saliste anoche ? What was to live ?  
S: Vivir .  
T: Vivir . And how do you say where ?  
S: Donde .T: Donde . Where did you live? :  
S: ¿Dónde viviste ?  
T: ¿Dónde viviste ? Where were you living? :  
S: So that’s the line. ¿Dónde vivías?   
T: Good. ¿ Dónde vivías ? So in many cases both line and point are perfectly fine. ¿ Dónde viviste ? 
¿Dónde vivías ? All that means is that the speaker has  two different ideas in their mind. Maybe 
you go abroad to study and I’ll tell you ¿dónde viviste ? Or maybe I’ll tell you ¿dónde vivías ?  
¿Dónde viviste ? Where did you live? And this idea in my mind which is this closed  amount of 
time. Where were you living? just means the idea in my mind is an ongoing idea of time. So many 
times it is completely interchangeable. What was to wait ?  
S: Esperar .  
T: Esperar . Esperar . So for you informal, we have -aste for the point in the past. So how would you 
say you waited , speaking informally ?  
S: Esperaste .  
T: Esperaste . Good. Did you wait for me? :  
S: ¿Me esperaste ?  
T: ¿Me esperaste ? Didn’t you wait for me? :  
S: ¿No me esperaste ?  
T: Why didn’t you wait for me? :  
S: ¿Por qué no me  esperaste ?  
T: Good. ¿ Por qúe no me esperaste ? What was to arrive ?  
S: Llegar .  
T: Llegar . Good. How do you say when did you arrive? When did you arrive?  (informally):  
S: ¿Cuándo llegaste ?T: Good. ¿Cuándo llegaste ? This is an example of when you woul d need the point, because you 
probably wouldn’t want to say when were you arriving , no? So here’s very strongly the point in 
time. When did you arrive? ¿ Cuándo llegaste ? So we have -aste and -iste for you informal. For 
they,  we have -aron  for -ar verbs and  -ieron  for -er/-ir verbs. So, how would you say they spoke ? 
They spoke :  
S: Hablaron .  
T: Hablaron . They waited :  
S: Esperaron .  
T: Good. They prepared it :  
S: Lo prepararon.  
T: Lo prepararon . Good. We have -aron  for -ar verbs and -ieron,  i-e-r-o-n, for -er/-ir verbs. How 
would you say they ate ?  
S: Comieron .  
T: Comieron . They left, they went out :  
S: Salieron .  
T: Salieron . They sold them :  
S: Los vendieron .  
T: Good. Los vendieron . Good. So let’s have a quick review of the panorama of this poi nt in the past 
with hablar  and comer  which we might want to use as our hooks. So we’ll begin with hablar.  
How do you say I spoke ?  
S: Hablé .  
T: Hablé . He spoke :  
S: Habló .  
T: Habló . We spoke :S: Hablamos .  
T: Hablamos . You spoke  (informal):  
S: Hablas te.  
T: Hablaste . And they spoke :  
S: Hablaron .  
T: Hablaron . Good. Hablé, habló, hablamos, hablaste, hablaron . Now let’s do the same for comer,  
so for -er/-ir verbs. How do you say I ate?  
S: Comí .  
T: Comí . He, she, it, you (formal) ate:  
S: Comió .  
T: Comió . We ate :  
S: Comemos .  
T: That’s the present.  
S: Comimos .  
T: Comimos . Good. You ate  (informally):  
S: Comiste .  
T: Comiste . And they ate :  
S: Comieron .  
T: Comieron . So what’s very interesting here is that for  -er/-ir verbs in the present, we had /e/ popping 
up everywhere. Vive,  viven,  vives  and just one / i/. Just one / i/ sound. Just one i popping up, 
vivimos.  But everything else was / e/ for -er/-ir verbs in the present, but in the past for  -er/-ir verbs 
we have i dominating the stage. We have the i, /i/ sound everywhere and this time the letter e, the 
/e/ sound, occupying only one space. Popping up in only one place which is -ieron.  Comí , comió , 
comiste , comimos , comieron , which is the exact inverse of what happens in the present tense. Wecan see also a logic that crosses over between the -ar group and the -er/-ir group. For example, we 
have I spoke , how is it?  
S: Hablé .  
T: Hablé . And he spoke :  
S: Habló .  
T: Habló . We saw the  -er/-ir in this past point has a special affiliation to the / i/ sound, the i, the letter 
i. So whilst we have hablé  for -ar verbs, for -er/-ir verbs what do we have? How would we say I 
ate?  
S: Comí .  
T: Comí . And whilst we have habló  for -ar verbs, what do we have for -er/-ir verbs? How would you 
say he ate ?  
S: Com ió.  
T: Comió . So it’s like the -ar version, but with that important / i/ popping up again. We have, for we 
spoke , what do we have?  
S: Hablamos .  
T: Hablamos . And for we ate :  
S: Comimos .  
T: Comimos . That important / i/, the i, the / i/ sound again. For you (informal) spoke,  what do we have?  
S: Hablaste .  
T: Hablaste . But you ate :  
S: Comiste .  
T: Comiste . You remember ed the importance of that i. Comiste . They spoke :  
S: Hablaron .  
T: Hablaron . And they ate :S: Comieron .  
T: Comieron . Again that important i and that e getting just one small look in, in that dot in the past 
to remind us that this is -er/-ir group, not just -ir. Just as what happened the other way around in 
the present. Good.
