Track 90  
T: There are also some variations that you might come across in dialect. For example, in most of 
Spain they use le and les whenever they’re referring to him or her, or you (formal), or you guys , or 
they. So instead of lo and la and los and las, they are using le and les, not just to make to him, to 
her, they will use it always when they’re referring to people and not things. So in most of Spain, 
le veo means I see him or her or you (formal). And lo veo means I see it . But in the great majority 
of the Spanish speaking world this isn’t the case.  
In most of Spain, you have vosotros , which is the you (plural informal), which is only used in 
Spain or most of Spain. But again, now here in Latin America so that might be something you want 
to listen out for if you will practice this dialect of Spanish. Many accents have an aspirated s in 
Spanish so you might hear / ehtá/ instead está. /cómo ehtá / instead  of cómo está . /ehpero / instead 
of espero .  
Around the Río de la Plata, for example, around Montevideo and Buenos Aires and in 30% of the 
Spanish speaking world, used exclusively or mixed with tú, you also have vos. Vos. Another word 
for tú. And the verb conjugations might change  slightly. So instead of puedes  you might hear 
podés . And because the accent’s coming on the end, that o isn’t splitting. Podés . Instead of 
quieres , querés .  
So you might come across small differences in different dialects of Spanish, but they are minor 
and you now have all of the know -how and experience to identify and understand them. And if 
you want, adopt them, you can adopt these differences. It’s advisable to speak like the people you 
are practicing with , because the more you speak like the Span ish that you are hearing, the more 
you understand. Now if you’re talking with people from different Spanish speaking countries, 
people with different dialects or accents in Spanish, then you might get something like a pan -
hispanic accent, let’s say, like m any native Spanish speakers who move around the Spanish 
speaking world or spend time with Spanish speakers from different countries also have. You might 
even find yourself switching between different accents when you are talking with people from 
different places. Again a phenomenon that we also find occurring amongst native speakers.  
Ahora hablamos español. Ahora somos hispanohablantes . Now we speak Spanish. Now we are 
Spanish speakers. Somos hispanohablantes y sólo tenemos que practicar, hablar y anal izarpara perfeccionar nuestro español . My advice now for the end of the course is to spend some 
time practicing, to get out and practice and expose yourself to Spanish as much as possible. And 
then maybe after a short while of practicing, you might want t o repeat the course to refresh and 
touch up on anything that you might be unsure of, especially having practiced and being solid on 
so many things it will really free up a lot of mental space to home in on the things that you are 
more uncertain with. And, in this way, repeating the course might be a little bit like when you 
watch a good movie twice and on the second time round you have a different experience.  
The most important thing in this journey of exploring and improving your Spanish is to not to 
forget to enjoy it, to not obsess with the destination but to enjoy the journey. You are already a 
Spanish speaker, you should enjoy it. There is a huge variety of literature, music, and cinema 
coming from Spanish speaking countries , so you can enjoy this an d at the same time effectively 
be studying, but it won’t feel like that. And we must bear in mind also that listening is a separate 
skill. You will hear many things that you could think your way through and say and maybe not 
understand them. So when you fi rst begin listening, don’t be overwhelmed by the fact that you 
don’t understand at the beginning as much as you can speak. All you have to do is insist on 
analyzing the language that you are exposed to, breaking it up and seeing what you can learn from 
that and although at the beginning it will seem very fast, once you get in the habit of this analysis 
and this breaking up of the language in the same way that we were doing when we were building 
up to create our sentences, in reverse deconstructing what you hear. The more you do this, the 
more Spanish will slow down. It will slow right down and you’ll hear a lot more. So like I said, 
don’t be overwhelmed by not understanding a lot at the beginning, insist, enjoy music, watch 
movies with subtitles, try to matc h between the subtitles in English and what you are hearing in 
Spanish. And just try to match bits and pieces. If you insist with this , very quickly  you will notice 
that you are understanding a lot more and that the language appears to slow right down.  
Thank you very much for participating in the Language Transfer project just by doing the course. 
Please share it. Language Transfer is a completely independent and unfunded project, so we don’t 
have any funds for the diffusion of this course. If this cour se got to you, it’s because somebody 
shared it, so please do keep sharing and telling people about this way of learning so that they also 
might enjoy this experience for free. All of our courses are completely free to promote language 
learning and to allow  anybody to have this experience anywhere in the world, but of course thefact that the courses are free doesn’t mean that we are immune to the world of monetary economics. 
We produce courses much slower than what we would like to, due to a lack of funds . So when you 
donate , actually what you’re donating is time that we are then able to spend on the construction, 
practice, and recording of new courses. If you’d like more information on the Language Transfer 
project, what we’re doing, and why, then chec k out our website www.languagetransfer.org . We 
really hope you enjoy using your new language and the new world that it opens up to you. Strangely 
the same one that was there all along.
