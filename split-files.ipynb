If you need help g etting over any anxiety about \\nforgetting or the possibility of forgetting, then just remind yourself that you can always repeat the \\ncourse at the end. So relax.It’s also important that you don't write anything down. You will carry around your new la nguage \\nin your head, not in a notebook. Some of the content you may forget, and that’s ok. That ’s part of the \\ndesign. Don’t worry about that, and just concentrate on understanding (not memorizing) the \\nexplanations  and building the sentences we give you .  \\nFind the time and place to do the audios where you are calm, undisturbed and can concentrate \\nsolely on your language learning experience. Using headphones should help you to tune out from the \\noutside world and concentrate on this experience.  \\nTry to be well rested when you do the courses. The tired mind makes all kinds of unproductive \\nshort cuts and careless mistakes. It is of the utmost importance that you don’t just listen to the audios, \\neven if you’re listening and understanding the process,  but that you pause every time I ask our \\nvolunteer student a question and work it out for yourself before hearing her response.  \\nOtherwise you will not have your own language learning experience  - you will just be witnessing \\nsomebody else’s. If you do not pause and work out the answer for yourself before continuing, you \\nwill finish knowing a lot about Spanish but not speaking Spanish.  \\nSometimes our student takes one second to reply; sometimes 30 seconds or more. What we’ve \\ndone in the editing proce ss is to leave a short pause for you to hit the pause button and then embark \\non your own mental journey before replying out loud  and continuing with us.  \\nThe more energy you have, the more information you will naturally assimilate. If you find yoursel f \\ntuning out during the explanations due to tiredness, then take a break and go back to it later. It ’s better \\nto do little often than a lot all at once. So 20 minutes a day you will find much more effective than a \\nfew hours crammed in over the weekend. B ut of course you will find your own balance with other \\ncommitments and how quickly you wish to learn Spanish.  \\nIf it’s been awhile since you’ve had to concentrate, then don’t worry. You will notice your \\nconcentration span increase very rapidly. And rem ember: think slowly to learn quickly. This isn’t a t \\nschool where we expect your hand to go up straight away with the correct answer through \\nmemorization; this is a different process where you are expected to take the time to think your answer \\nthrough and t o appreciate and understand that it’s those very processes of taking that time and thinking \\nthose answers through which makes us assimilate this new knowledge. You don’t even have to worry \\nabout memorizing this advice, because it will be revisited many ti mes during the course.Not only are all the courses at Language Transfer available for free download, but we are also an \\nunfunded and independent project. This allows us to create the best courses we can create , without \\nexternal monetary or public ity pressures. Now, to maintain this freedom and to continue with the \\nmany plans we have in the pipeline for more audio courses and also textbooks, we really do need help \\nwith donations. So if you love the course and are in a position to donate , then pleas e do. Many thanks \\nfor joining us, and let’s begin.\",\n",
       " \"Track 2  \\nTeacher : English and Spanish are two related languages. English is considered a Germanic language, \\nbut it ’s kind of half Latin. We have a huge amount of Latin vocabulary in English and t his Latin \\nvocabulary we can convert it over to Spanish really easily because Spanish is practically Modern \\nLatin.  \\nWhoever said Latin is a dead language lied. Just in the same way that Greek is a modern version \\nof ancient Greek, Spanish is like a modern version of Latin. It's actually a street Latin that became \\nSpanish. So we can identify Latin words in English , and we can, with just some rule or other, \\nconvert them over to Spanish , and this will give us around 3,000 words, I didn't count them , but \\nthere  are around 3,000 words. So for example , one of these rules is that words ending in -al tend \\nto come from Latin, so we can make them Spanish. So to give you an example, normal  in Spanish \\nis normal .  \\nStudent: Normal .  \\nTeacher : Normal , good. What do you notice different between normal  and normal ?  \\nStudent: Well, the accent.  \\nTeacher : What do you mean by the accent?  \\nStudent: Well the  …, well where the sound is stressed, with which vowel it’s stressed.  \\nTeacher : Where ’s it stressed in E nglish?  \\nStudent: On the o.  \\nTeacher : Good. At the beginning, right? NORmal , NORmal , and in Spanish we’re stressing the end, \\nright? NorMAL .  \\nStudent: NorMAL .  \\nTeacher : So if we assume the same happens with other words, how do you think you would say metal ?  \\nMetal :  \\nStudent: Metal .Teacher : Metal . To get a perfect accent in Spanish we just need to pronounce all of the vowels exactly \\nas they are written so a, e, i, o, u in Spanish is /ah/ , /eh/, /ee/, /oh/, /oo/, where in English the vowel,  \\nit can have many different sounds. Like if you look at the a sound in apple  or in mare , it's a very \\ndifferent sound. But a in Spanish is always going to be /ah/, e is always going to be /eh/. So if you \\npronounce the vowels as they're written , not this kin d of uh -uh-uh English vowels that we get , then \\nwe get a perfect Spanish accent.  \\nStudent: NorMAL , MeTAL .  \\nTeacher : Perfect. So we can begin to make sentences with this already. The word for is in Spanish is \\nes, e-s.  \\nStudent: Es.  \\nTeac her: Es. And this also means it is, she is , he is , or even you are , talking to somebody formally.  \\nSo now we can say he is normal , she is normal :  \\nStudent: Es normal .  \\nTeacher : Yeah , Es normal . And you pronounced an s which is excellent. English spe akers should \\nbeware that maybe they feel themselves pronouncing a z, because many times we have an s in \\nEnglish like in the word is, and we pronounce a z. So you might find slipping out a /z/, but this is \\nincorrect --you should be careful to pronounce an s. S. Es normal . Good, how would you say legal ?  \\nStudent: Legal .  \\nTeacher : Yeah , legal . So how would you say it is legal ?  \\nStudent: Es legal .  \\nTeacher : Es legal . Illegal ?  \\nStudent: Ilegal .  \\nTeacher : Ilegal , good. So here in Englis h we have an i and an e producing the same sound, “ illegal” .  \\nThe i and the e are producing the same sound, so this is really confusing if you want to learn \\nEnglish. But in Spanish you're not going to have this problem. The i is like in ink and the e is like \\nin elephant . Ilegal . Ilegal . So, it is illegal :Student: Es ilegal.   \\nTeacher : Good. Es ilegal . What if you wanted to say he is liberal ? You don't need the word for he if \\nyou know who you’re talking about, you can just use es.  \\nStudent: Es libera l.   \\nTeacher : Yeah, es liberal . Now Spanish is much more phonetic than English; what that means is that \\nthe letters are going to represent the same sound , where English has a million rules and a million \\nexceptions to those rules. I mean it's really ha rd even for native English speakers often to \\nunderstand how to pronounce a new word when they see it written; but you're not going to have \\nthat problem in Spanish. So you know natural  and you don't just want to just change the accent \\nand say natuRAL ; this is not Spanish. You want to think “how is it written?” and pronounce the \\nletters as they are. So how do you think you would say natural  in Spanish?  \\nStudent: Natural.   \\nTeacher : Natural , good. That’s a t, so you pronounce a t. A is like /ah/, u is like /oo/:  natural . Very \\ngood, and the accent on the end as well. It's natural ?  \\nStudent: Es natural.   \\nTeacher : Es Natural.  If you want to say it isn't  or it’s not, the word for not or don't  is the same as the \\nword for no. And t he word for no in Spanish is the same as the word  for no in English, but you \\npronounce it like in Spanish. So how do you think you say no in Spanish?  \\nStudent: No.  \\nTeacher : No. Good. And you put this before is if you want to say it is not , he is not , she is no t, you \\n(formal) are not . So how would that sound, it is not ?  \\nStudent: No es.   \\nTeacher : No es , good. So now we can say things like it's not normal :  \\nStudent: No es normal.   \\nTeacher : No es normal . How would you say ideal ? So really th ink about how it's spelled and try and \\npronounce each of those vowels as they're written. I like ink, e like elephant, a like apple.Student: Ideal.   \\nTeacher : Good. Ideal . How would you say it’s ideal ?  \\nStudent: Es ideal.   \\nTeacher : Es id eal. It’s not ideal:   \\nStudent: No es ideal.   \\nTeacher : Good. No es ideal.  Perfect. How would you say fatal?  \\nStudent: Fatal.   \\nTeacher : Fatal.  Good. Natal:   \\nStudent: Natal.   \\nTeacher : Natal , good. Colonial:   \\nStudent: Colonial.   \\nTeacher : Colonial.  Cultural :  \\nStudent: Culturial ?  \\nTeacher : So think about how it’s written.  \\nStudent: Cultural ?  \\nTeacher : Yes and perfect Spanish accent  there . Cultural , very nice. Annual:   \\nStudent: Anual.   \\nTeacher : Anual . And you cut this y sound tha t comes in English ann-y-ual. This y sound comes from \\nnowhere in English and you cut it out ’cause you focused on how it’s written. Anual. Very nice.  \\nDental:   \\nStudent: Dental.   \\nTeacher : Tooth in Spanish is diente . So this is coming from dental . So i f you look up tooth  in the \\ndictionary and you find diente , rather than treating it as a random piece of vocabulary that youhave to memorize, you can relate it back to dental . Oh okay, like dental  it comes from there. And \\nthis is useful for memory. A coupl e more: festival:   \\nStudent: Festival.   \\nTeacher : Personal:   \\nStudent: Personal.   \\nTeacher : Personal.  Good, total:   \\nStudent: Total.   \\nTeacher : Total. Good, verbal:   \\nStudent: Verbal.   \\nTeacher : Verbal . So if we wanted to say verb, we might not  have a rule to convert that word over. \\nBut if we know verbal  is verbal , we can guess that the verb is probably going to be the same in \\nSpanish. And most of the time words are either the same that we don’t have a rule, maybe we need \\nto stick an o or an  e or an a on the end. So we can make a guess. How do you think you say verb \\nin Spanish?   \\nStudent: Verbo ?  \\nTeacher : Yeah , that’s right. So with structure, with the building, when we’re going to be making \\nsentences with these words, we don’t ever want  to guess. We want to take our time and think it \\nthrough. But with vocabulary, we can happily guess and try. Imagine we said verba  for example, \\nand they would look at us funny and they would go “ah verbo ” and when that person says “ah, \\nverbo ” then we lear n “oh ok this is the right word”. And it’s the best way to learn quickly.\",\n",
       " \"Track 3  \\nT: So what was is or he is, she is , it is?  \\nS: Es.  \\nT: Es. Good, we can use this with some other convertible words as well to make sentences. Another \\nrule for these conver tible words is that words in English that end -ant or -ent, most of them we can \\njust stick an e on the end and they become Spanish. So for example , important  becomes \\nimportante . Importante . Where is the stress there?  \\nS: In the second last .   \\nT: Good. The stress is as much part of the word as the sounds, which is why we want to get into the \\nhabit of just processing where is the accent, not trying to memorize it, just looking where it is.  \\nNot trying to memorize it, just oberserving it.  How would you say it is important ?  \\nS: Es importante.   \\nT: Es importante . It's not important:   \\nS: No es importante .  \\nT: No es importante . How would you say different ?  \\nS: Diferente ?  \\nT: Diferente . It's not different:   \\nS: No es diferente.   \\nT: Good, no es dif erente.  How would you say constant ? Constant:   \\nS: Constante.   \\nT: Yeah, constante . How would you say it is constant ?  \\nS: Es constante.   \\nT: Es constante . If you add on -mente , -mente , this sound you get: -ly in English. If you want to say \\nconstantly  you can say constantemente , and it's one word, constantemente.S: Constantemente.   \\nT: Good, so how would you say legally ?  \\nS: Legalmente.   \\nT: Perfect, legalmente . Good, Illegally:   \\nS: Ilegalmente.   \\nT: Ilegalmente.  How do you think you say real in Spanish? Real:   \\nS: Real.   \\nT: Real . Good, when we have an r at the beginning you might hear it like a rolling r. Real . How do \\nyou think you would say really ?  \\nS: Realmente.   \\nT: Realmente . Real  also means royal. Like Real Madrid  is not, you know, real Madrid , it's Royal \\nMadrid . How would you say normally ?  \\nS: Normalmente.   \\nT: Good, normalmente . So what would it mean if I said to you normalmente es importante ?  \\nNormalmente es importante , what does that mean?  \\nS: Normally , as in usually, it's important .  \\nT: Very good, this is true. You actually use normally  like usually . Normalmente es importante .  \\nNow if we have a /j/ sound, a /j/ sound, in a convertible word so we're not working with the letter \\ng, we're working with the sound here, we're thinking about the sound. If we ha ve a /j/ sound in a \\nconvertible word, this /j/ is going to become /kh/ in Spanish. Now if you know how to say \\nArgentina  for example in Spanish, Argentina , if you've heard that anywhere, this is a good hook \\nto remember this rule. If we have a /j/ sound it 's going to become /kh/ as a sound. This doesn't \\nmean any g. For example how would you say global ?  \\nS: Global.   \\nT: Global . Globally:S: Globalmente.   \\nT: Globalmente . So it's not a g, it's the /j/ sound. General  is going to become?  \\nS: General.   \\nT: Very good, general . So we're causing a bit of friction in the throat, general . Generally:   \\nS: Generalmente.   \\nT: Generalmente.  Good. Original:   \\nS: Original.   \\nT: Original . Originally:   \\nS: Originalmente.   \\nT: Good, originalmente.  Digital:   \\nS: Digital.   \\nT: Digital . Good, naturally:   \\nS: Naturalmente.  \\nT: Good. How would you say naturally it's original ?  \\nS: Naturalmente es original.   \\nT: Good. So naturalmente , you can also use it a little bit like obviously , something like that. Words \\nending -ible or -able, we can also convert many of them. We just have to pronounce them syllable \\nby syllable and put the accent second from the end. So possible  becomes posible .  \\nS: Posible.   \\nT: Probable:   \\nS: Probable ?  \\nT: Yeah, probable . How would you say probably ?  \\nS: Probablemente.T: Y eah, probablemente . Possibly:   \\nS: Posiblemente.   \\nT: Good. Possibly it's original:   \\nS: Posiblemente es original.   \\nT: Good. Posiblemente es original . Flexible:   \\nS: Flexible.   \\nT: Flexible.  Good. So you can't do this - like if you say doable for example, you k now. It's when the \\n-able or -ible is really part of the word you will probably be able to do this. Some of these rules \\nare more useful than others, some of these rules have more exceptions than others. We want to just \\nget in the habit of identifying them a nd then getting this sense of what words in English are from \\nLatin, and which ones we can experiment with converting over to Spanish. Now, this gives us over \\n3,000 words, and there are enough words to be very conversational. So we want to feel free to \\nexperiment with the vocabulary, but at the same time we don't want to feel restricted by the fact \\nthat we might find an exception or we might use one that doesn't work. And feeling comfortable \\nabout that possibility of making that error is what really allows y ou to learn quickly.  \\nBecause with this experimentation, you find very quickly the words that you can use.\",\n",
       " \"Track 4  \\nT: How would you say urgent ?  \\nS: Urgente.   \\nT: Good, Urgente . Urgente . How would you say urgently ?  \\nS: Urgentemente.   \\nT: Urgentemente.  I love you  in Spanish is te quiero , literally I want you . You might have also heard \\nte amo . You should be wary of this difference. Te quiero  you can use with friends, you can use \\nwith lovers very soon. Te amo  is much much more serious but te quiero  is very  common and it \\nliterally means I want you . So te is you, we can get rid of this and here we are left with I want .  \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: Quiero . Good, how would you say I don’t want ?  \\nS: No quiero.   \\nT: No quiero.  Good, we just put no before. One of my favourit e rules for convertible words is the \\nrule for words ending -ion. This is an extremely useful rule. Words ending -ion are the same in \\nEnglish and Spanish, just in Spanish they have the accent on the end. So for example, in English \\nwe have opinion , and in Sp anish you are going to pronounce syllable by syllable, making sure that \\nyou are pronouncing the vowels as they are written and you are going to put the accent on the end.  \\nS: Opinión.   \\nT: Opinión . Good, passion ?  \\nS: Pasión.   \\nT: Pasión.  Good! And you prono unced an s because we don’t want /sh/. Preparation ? Now if \\nit’s -tion, t-i-o-n, if we have -tion, it’s going to be c-i-o-n in Spanish. And this c-i-o-n is pronounced \\n/ción/ like an  s in most of the Spanish -speaking world, or in most of Spain it's pronounce d /thion /. \\nSo you can choose, if you have a particular affiliation for Spain you can make this /th/. If not, I \\nsuggest using the /s/ sound because the majority of Spanish speakers are using this sound and it’salso much easier. It doesn’t appear diffic ult here: preparación , but if you want to ask for a beer \\nfor example with the /s/ sound you are going to ask for a /cervesa/ , if you are going to ask using \\nthe /th/  sound you are going to ask for a /cervetha/ . So, I would suggest unless you have a particu lar \\naffiliation with Spain or you particularly want to be practicing with some Spanish friends or \\nwhatever to use the /s/ sound. So you have a word like organization, that z as well is going to sound \\nlike an s  or a / th/. /Or-ga-ni-tha-thión /, so yo u see, much easier , then this is  /or-ga-ni-sa-ción/ .  \\nS: Organización.   \\nT: Good. Preparation:   \\nS: Preparación.   \\nT: Generation:   \\nS: Genaración.   \\nT: Generación.   \\nS: Generación.   \\nT: Good. We had a little bit slipping in from English, one of the vowels there,  but if you take it syllable \\nby syllable we get every vowel perfect. Generación:   \\nS: Generación.   \\nT: Confirmation:   \\nS: Confirmación.   \\nT: Confirmación.   \\nS: I was tempted to say confermación .  \\nT: Ah! But you thought “no, I, like ink.” This is act ually called “language transfer”, so this is negative \\nlanguage transfer. Things that come from English affecting your Spanish which are not part of \\nSpanish, are negative language transfer. And what is useful from English like these convertible \\nwords that w e are using, as far as language learning is concerned, this is positive language transfer. \\nSo part of our journey here is to identify what is negative language transfer and what is positive \\nlanguage transfer and using both to our advantage. And English bec omes more interesting whenwe learn Spanish because we start to see where some words come from, where is the inherent \\nwisdom in the vocabulary. So confirmation  for example means with signing . Con is with in \\nSpanish and firma  is signature . So when you conf irm you are doing it “with signature”. \\nConversation:   \\nS: Conversación.   \\nT: Good. And this means “with verses” , “with verse”. Confrontation:   \\nS: Confrontación.   \\nT: Confrontación. And front  actually , like in frontación , comes from frente  which  means forehead.  \\nSo it’s “with the forehead” , when you confront you go forward with the forehead. Complication:   \\nS: Complicación.   \\nT: Complicación.  Here com- is also con- but it changes to an m because of that p. It happens the \\nsame in English and Spanish . Complicación . But this is “with folding” from Latin, plicare , to \\nfold. You know when you fold stuff up I guess it gets more complicated or something like that. \\nThe reason why this is my favourite rule is because out of these words ending -ion, if you tak e the \\nwords that end –ation , if you take those words and you get rid of the –tion and you put an r on the \\nend you get the verb. Let me give you an example. Preparation , preparación , preparar .  \\nAnd there you get the verb to prepare . So there is like 1,00 0 verbs now we know in Spanish.  \\nWhat was generation ?  \\nS: Generación.   \\nT: Good. What is to generate ?  \\nS: Generar.   \\nT: Generar.  Good, what was confirmation ?  \\nS: Confirmación … Confirmación.   \\nT: Good. What is to confirm ?  \\nS: Confirmar.T: Yes, Confirmar.  So if you had to guess , how do you think you would say to sign ? If to confirm  is \\n“with sign ing”:  \\nS: Oh, firmar.   \\nT: Yes! Firmar.  Firmar  means to sign . Complication:   \\nS: Complicación.   \\nT: To complicate:   \\nS: Complicar.   \\nT: Good. So now we can make some sentenc es with these. What was again I want ? And if we forget \\nthat we can think of I love you  in Spanish and then take away the you.  \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: Quiero.  So now we can make some sentences. I want to prepare:   \\nS: Quiero preparar.   \\nT: Good, quiero preparar . How do you say cooperation?   \\nS: Cooperación.   \\nT: Good, cooperación . Good, you pronounced both o's, that was correct. Cooperación . It just sounds \\na tiny bit longer, cooperación . To cooperate:   \\nS: Cooperar.   \\nT: Cooperar.  I want to cooperate:   \\nS: Quiero cooperar.   \\nT: Good! How do you say cancellation ?  \\nS: Cancelación.   \\nT: And to cancel:   \\nS: Cancelar.T: I want to cancel:   \\nS: Quiero cancelar.   \\nT: Good. How do you think you would say I don’t want to cancel ?  \\nS: No quiero cancelar.   \\nT: Perfect, exploration:   \\nS: Expl oración .  \\nT: To explore:   \\nS: Explorar.   \\nT: Good. I want to explore:   \\nS: Quiero explorar.   \\nT: Perfect. The word for me in Spanish is the same as English. You are just going to pronounce it how \\nit’s written.  \\nS: Me.  \\nT: Me, good. How would you say I want to prepare myself ? Myself  is the same as me. So you would \\nsay I want to prepare me .  \\nS: Quiero prepararme.   \\nT: Good, quiero prepararme . I want to prepare me. I want to prepare myself  and this means I want \\nto get ready  and you can use this like I want to get r eady . Quiero prepararme . Now this probably \\nsounds quite formal in English: I want to prepare myself , but we should be aware that in English, \\nLatin words sound especially formal. Not always: cancel  doesn’t sound formal because it’s the \\nonly word we use to s ay cancel. But most of the time we have two words with similar meanings, \\nlike for example you might have to find  and then to encounter , which sounds a little bit more \\nformal or a little bit more literary or flowery. And these ones that have these different  feelings in \\nEnglish are generally Latin words. And the Germanic words like find, which in German is Finden  \\n(same word), sound more everyday, colloquial. Now we should bear in mind that that’s in English,and Latin words in Spanish, which is m ore Latin, of course don’t sound formal, they just sound \\nnormal.\",\n",
       " \"Track 5  \\nT: You might have noticed we are not using the word for I. Quiero  by itself means I want . There is a \\nword for I, the word for I is yo. Y-o.  \\nS: Yo.  \\nT: You only use it if y ou want to be emphatic. So if you want to say “ I want ”, to show that emphasis, \\nhow would you do it?  \\nS: Yo quiero.   \\nT: Yo quiero . I don’t want:   \\nS: No yo quiero.   \\nT: The same order as English. I don’t want:   \\nS: Yo no quiero.   \\nT: Good, yo no quiero . I don’t  want . Good, I don’t want to cancel:   \\nS: Yo no quiero cancelar.   \\nT: Good. Yo no quiero cancelar . How would you say celebration ?  \\nS: Celebración.   \\nT: Celebración,  very good. And to celebrate ?  \\nS: Celebrar.   \\nT: Celebrar . I want to celebrate:   \\nS: Quiero celeb rar.  \\nT: Quiero celebrar,  good. What would it mean if I say: Quiero ilustrar . Quiero ilustrar.   \\nS: I want to illustrate.   \\nT: Yes! I want to illustrate . This is an interesting word as well, actually. The lus inside of ilustrar  \\nmeans light, and the word luz, l-u-z, (so actually this z would be pronounced /th/ in most of Spain- /looth / - but in the rest of Spanish -speaking world /loos/ ) means light so you can use that word \\nas well. How would you say I want to find out ? Now in Spanish you will say so mething  like I want \\nto inform myself . I want to inform myself:   \\nS: Quiero informarme.   \\nT: Good, very good. Quiero informarme . So how was information ?  \\nS: Información.   \\nT: Información , very good. What was you, in the sense of I love you , I want you ?  \\nS: Te.  \\nT: And this is informal you, this is used informally. How would you say then I don’t want to oblige \\nyou? You might think “I don’t know this!” It’s very important, sentences that we think we don’t \\nknow, to take them block by block. And in this way we wi ll realise we can say so much in Spanish \\nthat we would have assumed that we don’t know how to say. So the first bit is I don’t want .  \\nS: No quiero.   \\nT: No quiero . To oblige ? So we look to see if we have obligation  in English: we have it, it’s a word.  \\nIt’s legal, so how is that?  \\nS: Obligación.   \\nT: Obligación . And to oblige  then?  \\nS: Obligar.   \\nT: Obligar.  So we don’t want to jump from oblige  to sticking -ar on it. We want to take that long \\nroute. Obligation , obligación , obligar . And then we find the word in  Spanish. So, I don’t want , \\nno quiero , to oblige you:   \\nS: No quiero obligarte.   \\nT: Good, no quiero obligarte . I don’t want to oblige you. I don’t want to make you do it.  So inEnglish we would say make you , maybe. Maybe oblige  sounds a little bit too form al, but in Spanish \\nit's everyday language. How would you say I don’t want to provoke you ? I don’t want to provoke \\nyou:  \\nS: No quiero provocarte.   \\nT: Good, no quiero provocarte . The word for it in Spanish is lo.  \\nS: Lo.  \\nT: Lo. So how would you say I want t o cancel it ?  \\nS: Quiero cancelarlo.   \\nT: Good, quiero cancelarlo . How would you say I want to regulate it ?  \\nS: Quiero regularlo.   \\nT: Good. I want to talk about this r. An initial r, like in regular  in most Spanish dialects, it's a rolling \\nr. You get this fl ick of the tongue, regular . Real, we saw this as well in real, real.  Now, if you \\ncan’t make that sound, I don’t want you to worry about it yet, it’s something that I couldn’t \\npronounce it actually, I couldn’t pronounce it for a long time, and it was really  frustrating, and I \\nwas trying to pronounce it, and when you are trying to pronounce it your mouth gets tense and \\nactually you need a very relaxed mouth to pronounce this r because you are kind of lifting your \\ntongue up a little bit and letting the air fla p it. Now that’s a muscle. If it’s tense the air can’t flap \\nit. So I tried a very long time, I got very frustrated and I gave up and then I was practising Spanish \\nin Peru, one day I started speaking about rice, which is arroz  and the r came out all by itse lf and I \\nwas so excited that I was jumping up and down saying arroz arroz arroz  and then I heard “the \\ngringo is hungry”. My advice if you can’t pronounce this sound is just to let it come. The more \\nyou hear, just because you want to pronounce it it’s going  to come. So initial r or two r's together \\ninside the word is going to pronounce this double r. So, the word for but in Spanish is pero .  \\nS: Pero.   \\nT: P-e-r-o. And the word for dog is perro . P-e-r-r-o.  \\nS: Perro.T: So that’s the difference. You have norm al r: pero .  \\nS: Pero.   \\nT: And it’s a bit different to English because it’s still kind of more pronounced. You know you are \\nstill using your tongue more there. Pero . And then perro , you keep that in the same position that \\nyou are using to make that Spanish r which is kind of a little bit more pronounced than the /r-r-r/ \\nEnglish sound , but you pass a little bit of air over it and you let that flick it. Perro.   \\nS: Perro.   \\nT: Now, like I said, I don’t want you to worry about if you can’t pronounce this, there  are even native \\nSpanish speakers that can’t pronounce this, so it’s really something I don’t want to inhibit anybody. \\nHow do you think is salvation  in Spanish?  \\nS: Salvación.   \\nT: Salvación.  So how do you think would be to save ?  \\nS: Salvar.   \\nT: Salvar . Thi s word that we used for it, lo, can also mean him. So how would you say I want to save \\nhim?  \\nS: Quiero salvarlo.   \\nT: Good, quiero salvarlo . I want to save him . How would you say situation ?  \\nS: Situación.   \\nT: Situación.  Good, now if you turn that into a ver b you actually get to situate , to place, to put \\nsomewhere. So how would that be?  \\nS: Situar.   \\nT: Situar . Good, participation:   \\nS: Participación.   \\nT: Participación . To participate:S: Partipi…   \\nT: So, take it syllable by syllable. This is very important, s o it doesn ’t become like a salad. You want \\nto take it syllable by syllable.  \\nS: Participation -participación -partipisar .  \\nT: Slower.  \\nS: Participar.   \\nT: Participar.  So we must take it slowly, sometimes you don’t need to take it slowly , but we want to \\nget in the habit of taking it slowly, dividing up syllable by syllable. We want to install the correct \\nprocess slowly. We don’t want to jump from participate  to participar  because maybe we end up \\nputting some extra sound “ participatar ” or something like this a nd we don’t want to do this. We \\nwant to take the long route. So for example , if you want to work out how to say to create  in Spanish \\nyou want to go through the long way, you want to go through creation .  \\nS: Creación.   \\nT: And then?  \\nS: Crear.   \\nT: Yeah. A nd that’s it, that’s the verb in Spanish. Crear , to create . How is to experiment ?  \\nS: So it’s experimentation . Experimentación -experimentar .  \\nT: Yeah, that’s it. Experimentar.  And this also means to experience . To experiment and to \\nexperience , which is a little bit of wisdom that I really like there from Spanish because your \\nexperience is like an experiment. If you think that your relationship with experience is scientific, \\nyou look what happens and you learn from it, or at least you should. So in Spanish,  there is a \\nsuggestion of that in the fact that these words are the same, to experience and to experiment  is the \\nsame verb, experimentar . The nouns are different. Experience  is experiencia , experiment  is \\nexperimento . But the verb, the act, is the same verb , experimentar . Actually this gives us another  \\nnice rule: experience , experiencia . If we have a word that ends in –ence or –ance , we can change \\n–ence to –encia  and –ance  to –ancia,  and we will get the word in Spanish. Difference ?S: Diferencia.   \\nT: Good. Influence:   \\nS: Influencia.   \\nT: Yeah, Existence:   \\nS: Existencia.   \\nT: Good! Consistence:   \\nS: Consi.. Consi… Consistencia.   \\nT: Good, Inconsistence:   \\nS: Inconsistencia.   \\nT: Good, Incongruence:   \\nS: Incongruencia.   \\nT: Yes.\",\n",
       " \"Track 6  \\nT: What do you think intento might mean? Quiero  is I want , and this -o is showing that it’s I. If you \\nheard intento , what do you think it might mean?  \\nS: Try?  \\nT: Yeah. How did you know that? Do you know how you knew that?  \\nS: Yeah. I sort of went from intend , I intend to do some thing .  \\nT: There is no rule here to convert intention  to a verb. It’s not –ation  so we can’t take off the –ation  \\nand put –r.  \\nS: Yeah.  \\nT: But we have intention , we know what is the meaning so we can hear a verb like this and understand \\nwhat it means. Intento means I try or I am trying. I try or I am trying . So how would you say I am \\ntrying to publish it ? Again it’s something you think “I can’t say this in Spanish!”  \\nS: Intento publicarlo.   \\nT: Good. Intento publicarlo.  I try to publish it or I am tryi ng to publish it . We’ve got both there.  \\nGood. How would you say I am trying to administrate it ?  \\nS: Intento administrarlo.   \\nT: Good . Intento administrarlo.  I am trying to imitate it  or I am trying to imitate him . It could mean \\neither.  \\nS: Inten to, OK, it’s imitation -imitación -imitar . Intento imitarlo .  \\nT: Exactly. Now h's in Spanish are completely silent. You must be careful not even to think  them \\nbecause they will have a habit of slipping out even if you think it. So it’s written, the h is writ ten \\nin convertible words for example, like hospital  (ends in –al) but it’s not pronounced. You must \\nimagine that it begins with an o. So how would you say hospital ?  \\nS: Hospital.T: See? You thought of the h and a little kind of aspiration came there, w hich is fine, but to get the \\nperfect accent you really want to think in your mind that it begins with o.  \\nS: Hospital.   \\nT: There you are perfect. Hospital.  Horrible :  \\nS: Horrible.   \\nT: Good. And here we have an example of double r inside the word. Horrible , horrible . If you can’t \\npronounce that you just make horrible  and it will be perfectly understood: there is no problem \\nthere. Good. How would you say habitual ?  \\nS: Habitual .  \\nT: Habitual . Habitually:   \\nS: Habitualmente.   \\nT: Habitualmente.  The word for now in Spanish is ahora .  \\nS: Ahora.   \\nT: This is spelled a-h-o-r-a. A-h-o-r-a. Ahora.   \\nS: Ahora.   \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Is the h silent in every…  \\nT: Yeah. Unless it’s c-h in which case it’s like English /ch/. Ahora  is actually the combination of two \\nwords: a which mean s to and hora  which means hour . So it’s something like “to the hour”. So that \\ngives us another couple of words as well, a meaning to in the sense of direction, to somewhere, \\nand hora  meaning hour . Ahora , now. So how would you say I want to cancel it , but I don’t want \\nto cancel it now ? We said that the word for but is pero . So we want to divide it up piece by piece. \\nI want:   \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: To cancel it:S: Cancelarlo.   \\nT: Good. But:  \\nS: Pero.   \\nT: I don’t want:   \\nS: No quiero.   \\nT: To cancel it:   \\nS: Cancelarl o.  \\nT: Now:   \\nS: Ahora.   \\nT: Perfect! So a big sentence which we might imagine that we can’t take on ; if we divide it up bit by \\nbit we realise that we can think our way through it. The word for I go or I am going  in Spanish is \\nvoy. S: Voy.   \\nT: Voy.   \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: Good. Now this is actually spelled v-o-y. Now the v in Spanish can sound like a v in English like a \\n/v/ or it can sound like a soft b like /boy/. You might be familiar with the word vamos  which means \\nlet’s go , literally we are going , used a lot like let’s go , vamos . Now this is spelled v-a-m-o-s. What \\nyou probably hear there is a b. It really depends where you are: in the southern cone around \\nArgentina and Chile you hear a lot more /v/  kind of pronunciation in many places. Generally in \\nthe Spanish -speaking world i t’s like a soft b so we want to make that association now between v \\nand soft b. To remember this word, voy, we can think of a voyage so we can see the connection \\nthere between voyage  and to go . I go or I am going ?  \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: I am going now:   \\nS: Voy ahora.T: Voy ahora . I am not going now:   \\nS: No voy ahora.   \\nT: Good, No voy ahora.  How do you think you might say visit in Spanish?  \\nS: Visitar ?  \\nT: Yeah. Why did you think that? Was it just a guess?  \\nS: Well, it’s visitation …  \\nT: Visitation , does that exist?  \\nS: I think so, visitation rights?  \\nT: Exactly! Very good! This is it. It’s a word that exists that we only use in some context, like \\nvisitation rights. Visitar , visitar , if you are not comfortable with the soft b just pronounce a v, it \\ndoesn’t matter. When you practice Spanish you are going to pick up the accent of who you are \\nspeaking to so it’s not a fundamental issue of ours right now. So, visitar . I want to visit him:   \\nS: Quiero visitarlo.   \\nT: Good. We can look at some other words now wi th this v sound and experiment a little bit with the \\nsound. So how do you think you would say visible  in Spanish?  \\nS: Visible.   \\nT: Good. There is something very good that you are doing here, you are not pronouncing that s as a z \\nlike in English: visible . Many people at home will find themselves doing this, putting that z there \\nfrom English and pronouncing vi-zi-ble. We don’t want that, we want visible . And the v is like a \\nsoft b. If you want more elaboration of what is this soft  b you can put a small piece of paper in \\nfront of your mouth and make the b in English like bucket  and you will see that paper move with \\nthat burst of air that comes with bucket . That hard b in English is a plosive sound, it means you \\ngather up a little bit of air and you shoot it out when you make that b, where this b doesn’t have \\nthat, it's a soft one. So you can experiment with that, again like I say we don’t want to stress out \\nabout sounds, to use a v sound is perfectly fine. Viral:   \\nS: Viral.T: Viral . Good. So if viral  is viral  how do you think virus  might be?  \\nS: Viro .  \\nT: Virus.  It’s actually the same word, you are just pronouncing it exactly as it is. Virus.   \\nConvenient:   \\nS: Conveniente ?  \\nT: Conveniente.  Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 7  \\nT: How would you say I want to carry on ? Now you think “ carry on , I don\\'t know this!” So, one of \\nthe skills we want to really make use of these convertible words is to find the Latin equivalent of \\ncarry on. I want to carry on, I want to go on, I want to …? What is the Latin word that we could \\nuse here ? Nothing comes to mind?  \\nS: Like?  \\nT: So, think of -  \\nS: Ah, continue .  \\nT: So you can think of a -tion word that has something to do with carrying on?  \\nS: Continuation .  \\nT: Exactly, good. So, I want to continue:   \\nS: Quiero continuar.   \\nT: Quiero continuar . I want to continue it:   \\nS: Quiero continuarlo.   \\nT: Good. I am trying to continue:   \\nS: I’ve already forgotten what trying  is.  \\nT: So it\\'s not about remembering, it\\'s about knowing how to find it. So there are a few things you \\ncould think about, that wh en we discuss this word, that could lead you back to it, and the important \\nthing is to take that time to have those thoughts rather than just, \"Oh, do I know it? Do I not?\"  \\nS: Intención.   \\nT: Intención.  There wasn\\'t a rule here because it doesn\\'t finish -ation. Our rule was for ones that \\nfinish -ation , but it was very similar. Do you remember what it is now?  I try, so it ends in -o like- \\nS: Ah, intento .T: Intento , good, so that\\'s I try. We want to see first if we can find it... relaxed, not... you kno w if \\nyour brain locks on \"Do I remember it or don\\'t I?\" Game over. But if you go “ Okay , what was that \\nrelated to , what was that about?\" And just see what pops up, then you are much more likely to get \\nit.  \\nSo, Intento . Intento  is I try. I try or I am trying to continue:   \\nS: Intento continuar.   \\nT: Good. Intento continuar.   What is demostración ? Demostración :  \\nS: Demonstration .  \\nT: Demonstration . Do you notice something different though? There\\'s some change here. \\nDemostración ?  \\nS: There’s no n.  \\nT: Good. There\\'s no n. Demostración . So how would you say to demonstrate ?  \\nS: Demostrar.   \\nT: Demostrar . Now if you get rid of that de-, how would it sound?  \\nS: Mostrar.   \\nT: Mostrar , and that means to show . To show . Mostrar . So we might think again, mostrar has no \\nconnection that we can hook on to, but usually when we have a look we can find some connection \\nthrough English, Latin English, that helps us interiorize. Mostrar , to show . The word for \\nsomething  is algo. Algo . A-l-g-o. Algo.   \\nS: Algo.   \\nT: Algo , good.  What was the word for you, like in I love you , how was I love you ?  \\nS: Te quiero.   \\nT: Te quiero , so it was te. So how would you say, I want to show you something , in this order, I want \\nto show you something:   \\nS: Quiero mostrarte algo.T: Quiero m ostrarte algo.  I want to show you something . What again was I go or I am going and it \\nwas related to voyage  we said.  \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: The beginning bit of voyage , and you\\'re mostly going to hear it pronounced more like a soft b.  \\nVoy.  Voy.   \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: Now, ju st as in English, we say I am going to...  and we talk about the future. I am going to continue. \\nI am going to eat later . We can do exactly the same thing in Spanish. The only difference is that  \\neven though, for example, if we use continue – continuar - continuar  means to continue . In \\nSpanish we say voy a continuar . It\\'s actually because voy is a verb of movement, and when we \\nare putting a \"to\" form, a verb that is \"to\" something like continuar  after a verb of movement, a \\nverb that has some kind of motion i n its meaning like voy: I am going , Spanish wants to show this \\nfeeling of motion so you say I am going to  and you put the to for that movement, even if you\\'re \\nnot actually moving and you\\'re just using it to speak about the future.  \\nSo, if you want to say, for example, I am going to confiscate it. I am going to confiscate it:   \\nS: Voy a confiscarlo.   \\nT: Good. Voy a confiscarlo.  Very good. How do you say I am going to examine it? I am going to \\nexamine it:   \\nS: Voy a examinarlo.   \\nT: Good. Voy a examinarlo.  Good.  Now we said lo is it or him. Now the plural of him is them . This \\nis not very obvious in English because him and them , they look very different as words. We don\\'t \\never think of them  as the plural of him or of her but it is. It\\'s very obvious in Spanish, lo means \\nhim or it and if you want to get them , if you want to make it plural, what do you think you might \\ndo?  \\nS: Just add the s? Los.T: Los. Good. So now we have the word for them . To see  is ver, ver. We have view in English, like \\nview, ver. So how would  you say, I want to see them ?  \\nS: Quiero a verlos ?  \\nT: Why a here?  \\nS: Quiero verlos.   \\nT: Quiero verlos.  So, ver is to see. If you say I am going to see them , how is it going to be?  \\nS: Voy a verlos.   \\nT: Good. Voy a verlos . But if you say, I want to see th em?  \\nS: Quiero verlos.   \\nT: And if you say I am trying to see them ?  \\nS: Intento verlos.   \\nT: Good. No a. Intento verlos . Because ver is to see . To try , so trying  in its \"to\" form, to try  is \\nintentar . Intentar . This is to try . So how would you say I want to t ry?  \\nS: Quiero intentar.   \\nT: Good. I am going to try:   \\nS: Voy a intentar.   \\nT: Good. With a. Voy a intentar.  I am going to try to see them ? I am going to try to see them:   \\nS: Voy a intentar a verlos . No, verlos .  \\nT: Very good.  \\nS: Voy intentar -  \\nT: Slower.   \\nS: Voy a intentar verlos .T: Good. Voy a intentar verlos.  Good. Let me give you another example of a verb that connects with \\nthis a, so voy isn\\'t isolated, we can understand the concept better if we see another verb of \\nmovement. So another verb of movem ent is pasar . What do you think pasar  means?  \\nS: Is it to pass ?  \\nT: Yes, pasar  is to pass  and to pass by , so I\\'m going to pass by to visit you . I\\'m going to pass by to \\nvisit you . How would we say this? The first bit is I am going .  \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: Good. I am g oing to pass by:   \\nS: A pasar.   \\nT: Good. To visit you:   \\nS: Visitarlo,  visitarte.   \\nT: Well actually lo, other than him and it, can also mean formal you, so if you\\'re speaking formally, \\nyou can use this lo as well. But I want to go back to pasar . Pasar  is a v erb of movement.  Let\\'s \\ntake the sentence again from the beginning. The whole sentence is I\\'m going to pass by to visit \\nyou.  \\nS: Voy a. So it\\'s voy a pasar a visitarlo .  \\nT: Good, lo if you are speaking formally or te if you are speaking informally. Voy a pasar a visitarte . \\nVoy a pasar a visitarlo . Which would mean him, it or you (formal). How would you say formal , \\nby the way, in Spanish?  \\nS: Formal.   \\nT: And formally:   \\nS: Formalmente.   \\nT: Very good. Now, if you want to say, I am going to try to pass by  to visit you  we have to think \\nwhich ones we are going to use this a with and which ones not, which is a great exercise for us to \\ninternalise this rule. So, I am going to try:S: Voy a intentar.   \\nT: To pass by:   \\nS: A, no. Voy a intentar pasar.   \\nT: To visi t you:   \\nS: A visitarte.   \\nT: Very good. So we learned that rule. Voy a intentar pasar a visitarte . There\\'s not many times that \\nwe have something between the verbs so there\\'s not going to be a lot of rules like this, don\\'t worry, \\nbut this one\\'s important bec ause there are many important verbs of motion that we will be putting \\nthis a after. How was to demonstrate  again?  \\nS: Demonstrar.   \\nT: And what happened to that n?  \\nS: Demostrar.   \\nT: Demostrar. And what is to show ? You get rid of -  \\nS: Mostrar.   \\nT: Good. Mostrar. And the word for something  I mentioned was algo, algo.  \\nS: Algo.   \\nT: Something . I want to show you something . Let\\'s speak informally. I want to show you something .  \\nSo we\\'re going to use te.  \\nS: Quiero mostrarte algo.   \\nT: Good. I want to show you som ething . Quiero mostrarte algo.  So maybe you call somebody and \\nyou say where are you ? I\\'m at home. I want to pass by to show you something. I want to pass by \\nto show you something:   \\nS: Quiero pasar a  - what was it?  \\nT: To show you something .S: Mostrarte a lgo.  \\nT: Good. Quiero pasar a , because we had the verb of movement, mostrarte  algo. So if we are \\nconnecting a verb of movement to another verb we connect using this extra a, to. Quiero pasar a \\nmostrarte algo . Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 8  \\nT: What was again the word th en for it or for him or for you (formal)?  \\nS: Lo.  \\nT: Lo. If we make this feminine, so we change the o to an a, and we\\'re going to see other examples \\nof this way of making something feminine in Spanish, we get la. And this means her, it (a feminine \\nthing), so objects as well. Well, not objects. Objects don\\'t have gender. When people speak about \\nlanguages that have gender, they tend to think that the object has the gender. But it\\'s not the object, \\nit\\'s the word.  \\nYou might  have two words for the same obj ect, and one might be masculine and one might be \\nfeminine. So it\\'s the word. A feminine word for example usually are ones that end in a. So like \\ncasa, casa,  house. If you want to say I want to see it , and with this it you mean the house. What \\ndo you thin k you will say? I want to see it:   \\nS: Quiero verla.   \\nT: Good. Quiero verla.  Now what else could that sentence mean, other than I want to see it  (the \\nfeminine thing)? what else could it mean?  \\nS: Oh. It could also mean I want to see her .  \\nT: Yes, exactly. S o we get quite a few meanings just with this little lo and adding an  s to it or changing \\nthe o to an a. We actually get a lot of options. La could mean her, and it also could mean you \\n(formal ) talking to a female. So you could be saying I want to see y ou, formally. Now, where you \\nuse the formal language and the informal language really, really depends on the dialect. So the safe \\nway is to go in with the formal and to see what happens and to see how people address you and \\nsee how people address each othe r in this context, and you can adjust accordingly. For example, \\nin Spain, when you meet somebody, when you\\'re going to a shop, when you meet somebody for \\nthe first time - with the exception of kind of young peers - the common thing is to begin spea king \\nformally. If I compare this to Buenos Aires, for example, in Argentina, it\\'s almost never used, this \\nformal way of addressing people. In fact, it\\'s used more often to insult somebody with an extralayer of sarcasm or irony, than say, than it\\'s actuall y used sincerely to be formal. So it really \\ndepends on the place. You want to go and see.  \\nBut to play safe, you can use the formal, which will be lo or la, speaking to a male or to a female.  \\nLo and la instead of te.  \\nQuiere  means he wants , she wants , it wants  or you (formal) want . We can see that these four, they \\nband together. Not just in words like lo and la, but in the verbs as well. We saw it with es, that es \\nmeans it is, she is , he is, you (formal) are. So they will band together. Quiere  means he wants, she \\nwants , it wants , you (formal) want . So, how would you say you want to visit me ?  \\nS: Quiere visitarme.   \\nT: Good. Quiere visitarme . You want to visit me . Now if you want to make that a question, in English, \\nyou put do, do you want ?  But in Spanish,  you won\\'t do anything like that. In Spanish, you will \\njust make it sound like a question with your voice. So, how would you say Do you want to visit \\nme?:  \\nS: ¿Quiere visitarme?   \\nT: Good. ¿Quiere visitarme?  How would you say You don\\'t want to visit me ?  \\nS: No quiere visitarme.   \\nT: You sounded very sad when you said that. No quiere visitarme.  Now if you want to say Don\\'t you \\nwant to visit me ? Again, English gets really complicated there. But not Spanish. So, don\\'t you want \\nto visit me ?:  \\nS: ¿No quiere visita rme?   \\nT: Good. ¿No quiere visitarme?  You could add the word for why. The word for why is por qué . Por \\nqué.  \\nS: Por qué.   \\nT: It\\'s actually the word for because as well . So why don\\'t you want to visit me ?:  \\nS: ¿Por qué no quiere visitarme?T: Good. ¿Por qu é no quiere visitarme?  The verb for to come  is venir .  \\nS: Venir.   \\nT: So of course you could hear  /v/, like I just pronounced for you, so you would get the spelling venir . \\nBut more commonly you would hear /benir /, /benir /, like a soft b. Firstly,  let\\'s say, do you want to \\ncome ?:  \\nS: ¿Quiere venir?   \\nT: Good. ¿Quiere venir ? And a nice way to remember venir , actually, is conveniente , convenient , \\n\"with coming\", when things come together. Or if you ever heard welcome  in Spanish, you might \\nhave heard bienvenido  or bienvenida,  bienvenidos, bienvenidas . Literally the same as welcome . \\nWell is bien, and come , there we have venidos , a different version of venir . So venir , to come . If \\nyou want to say the house , it\\'s la casa .  \\nS: La casa.   \\nT: What was to?  \\nS: A.  \\nT: What is to the house ?  \\nS: A la casa.   \\nT: Good. Do you want to come to the house ?:  \\nS: ¿Quiere venir a la casa?   \\nT: Good. How\\'d you say Do you want to come to visit me? Do you want to come to visit me?:   \\nS: ¿Quiere venir a visitarme?   \\nT: Good. Don\\'t you want to come to visit me?:   \\nS: ¿No quiere venir a visitarme?   \\nT: Good. ¿No quiere venir a visitarme ? What was the word for why?  \\nS: Por qué.T: Good. Why don\\'t you want to come to visit me?:   \\nS: ¿Por qué no quiere venir a visitarme?   \\nT: Very good. ¿Por qué no quiere venir a visitarme?  Good. And of course, here we\\'re using a \\nbecause we have venir . A verb of coming and going, like voy, voy a, venir a , when we\\'re \\nconnecting to a “to” form. The word for I owe , I owe  in Spanish is debo . Debo.   \\nS: Debo.   \\nT: Debo.  The English word debt which is spelled d-e-b-t has this b from debo . It comes from there. \\nWe don\\'t pronounce it in English, of course. But this word is from Latin and debo  is I owe . The \\nuseful thing about I owe  is that you can use it like I must . So if you want to say I must continue , \\nyou say I owe to continue. I owe to continue . And that\\'s the meaning of I must continue . So how \\nwould you say that: I must continue ?  \\nS: Debo continuar.   \\nT: Good. How would you say I must identify it ?  \\nS: Debo - identif y. Identification.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Identificación.   \\nT: Very good.  \\nS: Identificar.   \\nT: Very good.  \\nS: So it\\'s debo identificarlo .  \\nT: Good. Debo identificarlo.  I must or I owe to identify them. I must identify them:   \\nS: Debo identificarlos.   \\nT: Good. Debo i dentificarlos . Or if they were feminine things, what change do you think you would \\nsee?S: Las.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Debo identificarlas.   \\nT: Good.',\n",
       " \"Track  9  \\nT: To know  in Spanish is saber . Saber.   \\nS: Saber.   \\nT: Saber.  You may have heard in British slan g He's got savvy, she's got savvy . Have you ever heard \\nthat?  \\nS: Yeah.  \\nT: And that comes from Latin actually. That slang is coming from Latin. Saber  is to know . He's got \\nsaber . He's got savvy . Saber  is spelt with a b, but in English we're saying savvy  with a /v/. So \\nwe're seeing even that connection between the sounds of v and b crossing between English and \\nSpanish. Saber , savvy . So saber  is to know . So if you want to say I want to know ?  \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: How would you say I don't want to know ?  \\nS: No quiero saber.   \\nT: Good. How would you say he wants to know  or she wants to know  or you (formal) want to know ?  \\nS: Quiere saber.   \\nT: Good. You change  the -o to -e. And you get quiere . Quiere saber.  He doesn't want to know:   \\nS: No quiere saber.   \\nT: Why doe sn't he want to know?:   \\nS: ¿Por qué no quiere saber?   \\nT: I want to know why he doesn't want to know:   \\nS: Quiero saber por qué no quiere saber.   \\nT: Very good. Quiero saber por qué no quiere saber.  Very good. The word for yes in Spanish is sí.  \\nS: Sí.T: This is also the word for if. So how do you say if?  \\nS: Si.  \\nT: Good. I want to know if you want to know . Of course we're speaking formally. This is the one we've \\nlearned so far. I want to know if you want to know:   \\nS: Quiero saber si quiere saber.   \\nT: Good . Quiero saber si quiere saber.  I want to know if he wants to invite me . So the first bit is I \\nwant to know:   \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: Saber , b sound 'cause it's a b here.  \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: If:  \\nS: Si.  \\nT: He wants to invite me:   \\nS: Quiere invitarme.   \\nT: So you see if you think about it block by block, it's very simple. If we think slowly , we learn very \\nquickly and the process gets much faster. How do you say imagination ?  \\nS: Imaginación.   \\nT: Good. I don't want to imagine. I don't want to imagine it:   \\nS: No quiero imaginarlo.   \\nT: Good. And what was to come ? And we said that we could remember it if we look at convenient , \\nconveniente , which is like “with coming”.  \\nS: Venir.T: Venir . Good. I want to know if she wants to come to the house to visit me. I want t o know if she \\nwants to come to the house to visit me . So again it might be something that looks overwhelming \\nthat we can't say. But if we divide it up: I want to know:   \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: If:  \\nS: Si.  \\nT: She wants to come:   \\nS: Quiere venir.   \\nT: Good. To the house:   \\nS: A la casa.   \\nT: Good. To visit me:   \\nS: A visitarme.   \\nT: Good! You put a there. Because even though we have a la casa , there in between, you stayed with \\nthe feeling of venir  and you wanted to connect it to the next verb. And you are 100% corre ct to do \\nthat. I want to know why she doesn't want to come to the house to visit me. I want to know why she \\ndoesn't want to come to the house to visit me . I want to know :  \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: SaBer.   \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: Why:   \\nS: Por qué.   \\nT: She doesn't want:   \\nS: No quiere.   \\nT: To come to the house:S: Venir a la casa.   \\nT: To visit me:   \\nS: A visitarme.   \\nT: Good. Very good. Well done. Quiero saber por qué no quiere venir a la casa a visitarme . Very \\ngood. So what we most want to take away from this is the confidence to try to say what we are \\nalmost sure we cannot say. Because we have this wonderful advantage as English speakers, that \\nwe have so much vocabulary that we can convert over to Spanish that we won't realize we can \\nconvert over to Spanish until we try it. I'll just give you now a couple of sentences for listening \\npractice. What does it mean if I say Voy a invitarlo , pero no voy a invitarlo ahora ?  \\nWhat did I say? First  bit is Voy a invitarlo :  \\nS: I'm going to invite them .  \\nT: Lo.  \\nS: Oh, you. Oh.  \\nT: It could be you. You formal.  \\nS: You formal or him.  \\nT: Yeah. Voy a invitarlo .  \\nS: Or it?  \\nT: Or it if it can make some sense. I'm going to invite it . Voy a invitarlo , pero . What is pero ?  \\nS: But.  \\nT: But. No voy a invitarlo ahora :  \\nS: But I w on't invite him now .  \\nT: Very good. Quiero iniciarlo ahora. Quiero iniciarlo ahora :  \\nS: I want to start now.   \\nT: Good. And something missing though. Quiero iniciarlo ahora :S: Ah. I want to start it now.   \\nT: Good. Quiere iniciarlo ahora.  Quiere iniciarlo ahora :  \\nS: You want or he wants.   \\nT: Good. Or she.  \\nS: Or she wants.   \\nT: ¿Por qué no quiere informarme?  Por qué no quiere informarme?:   \\nS: Why doesn't he want to let me know? To inform me?   \\nT: Yeah. Perfect. But this is perfect what you did. You foun d the meaning, but you said it how it's \\ncomfortable for you in English. Exactly. Why doesn't he want to inform me? Why doesn't he want \\nto let me know?  Perfect. How is justification  in Spanish?  \\nS: Is it a /kh/ sound?  \\nT: Good, yes. If it's /j/.  \\nS: So it 's justificación ?  \\nT: Justificación . To justify :  \\nS: Justificar.   \\nT: Justificar.  I'm not trying to justify myself . I'm not trying to justify myself . What is myself  in \\nSpanish?  \\nS: Me.  \\nT: Yes. Same as me. Same as me. So, I'm not trying:   \\nS: No intento ju stificarlo . No. Justificarme.   \\nT: Good. No intento justificarme . But I want to explain . Now explain  is an exception. We have \\nexplanation  in English. But this in Spanish is explicación . It changes, so it's an exception. We \\ndon't say explanación , but explic ación . We have this in English as well. We have in English \\ninexplicable . How do you say that in Spanish?S: Inexplicable.   \\nT: Yes. We have it in English this root of the c sound with explain . We say explain , but then we say \\ninexplicable . So explanation  is explicación  in Spanish. So how is to explain ?  \\nS: Explicar.   \\nT: Explicar . So but I want to explain:   \\nS: Pero quiero explicar.   \\nT: Good. Do you remember how to say something ?  \\nS: Algo.   \\nT: Algo . Well done. But I want to explain you something . In English maybe it's more common we \\nwould say I want to explain something to you . But in Spanish we can just say But I want to explain \\nyou something . And let's say  it informally. So what was the word for you, for informal? We can \\nremember it from I love you .  \\nS: Te.  \\nT: Yes. Te. Te quiero.  So but I want to explain you something .  \\nS: Pero quiero explicarte algo.   \\nT: Very good. Pero quiero explicarte algo.  Let's say it al l together. I'm not trying to justify myself, \\nbut I want to explain something to you . So I'm not tr ying is the first bit. Now I want 100% of your \\nmental energy on I'm not trying . All of your attention on I'm not trying  then we look at the next bit \\nand we forget I'm not trying . Once we've said it, we don't need to hold it. I'm not trying:   \\nS: No intento.   \\nT: To justify myself:   \\nS: Justificarme.   \\nT: Good. We can forget that bit. But:  \\nS: Pero.T: I want:   \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: To explain you:   \\nS: Explicarte.   \\nT: Something:   \\nS: Algo.   \\nT: Very good. No intento justificarme , pero quiero explicarte algo.  Very good. Well done.\",\n",
       " 'Track 10  \\nT: How would you say to ventilate ?  \\nS: Ventilar.   \\nT: Yeah. Ventilación -ventilar . How would you say to separate ?  \\nS: Separar.   \\nT: Good. Separar.  So in English what we pronounce as separate , maybe like an e sound, but i f you \\nlook at how it’s written, it’s an a. Separar.  Good. So how was to know , something to do with \\nsavvy ?  \\nS: Saber.   \\nT: SaBer.   \\nS: Saber.   \\nT: With a b.  \\nT: Another way to remember this is Homo sapien , there’s that connection there. The Homo sapien  is \\nthe wise creature . Supposedly. And how was to come ? Convenient ?  \\nS: Venir.   \\nT: Venir.  Good. So we can remember that convenient  is “with coming”, when things come together, \\nthey are convenient. We’ve seen the “to” forms of the verb end in r and the “I” forms  most of the \\ntime end in o. For example, I want , how was that?  \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: Quiero . I owe ? Which we can use like must :  \\nS: Debo.   \\nT: Debo . I try:   \\nS: Intento.T: Intento.  Unless the verb is irregular, and we know some irregular verbs already. We saw I am \\ngoing .  \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: Voy. So that doesn’t end in o, or in /o/. Voy. It’s an irregular verb. So how does this work? Now \\nall “to” verbs, all verbs in the “to” form, when we say to go , to want , to segregate , how would you \\nsay to segregate ?  \\nS: Segregation -segregación -segregar .  \\nT: There you are. All of them in the “to” form end in the letter r. They either end in -ar, -er, or -ir. \\nWe have an example of each. We have like a thousand examples of the ones that end in -ar because \\nthis is the  one that we’re using to build these from, for example, simulation -simulación -simular . \\nRevelation -revelación -revelar . Respiration -respiración -respirar . What do you think respirar  \\nmeans?  \\nS: To breathe .  \\nT: Yes. To breathe. So we could say to respire  litera lly and we go, oh of course, this would be how I \\nwould say breathe in Spanish. Respirar.  Good. So we have many examples of -ar verbs. We have \\none example of an -er verb, in its “to” form, which is to know . How was that? To know:   \\nS: Saber.   \\nT: Saber . And we have the example of the verb ending -ir, ir, which is to come .  \\nS: Venir.   \\nT: Venir. Good . So all “to” forms are going to end in an r. And it’s either going to be -ar, -er, or -ir. \\na-r, e-r, i-r. In fact, and talking about “to” forms, it’s actually wi th this “to” that we identify what \\nis a verb. Now it’s good to talk about this because at school we learn that verbs are doing words, \\nwhich is really kind of unhelpful, because to be  for example is, there’s nothing, you’re not doing \\nanything. If you say is, he is here , what is he doing? But is is a verb. Is is a verb because it comes \\nfrom to be . We don’t say He be here . We say He is here . So the way we identify what is a verb, is \\nthat you can put to in front of it. To be, to stay, to go . These are verbs. And in Spanish, these are \\ngoing to end in r. Either -ar, -er, or -ir. Now the way we get the “I” version, is we take off thisending, we chop off this -ar, -er, or -ir and we put -o. We have an example already. We know how \\nis to try . What was to try ?  \\nS: Intentar.   \\nT: Intentar.  Good. And I try:   \\nS: Intento.   \\nT: Intento.  Good. So we take off -ar and we put on -o. But something else is happening as well.  \\nIntentar . Intento.   \\nS: The accent.  \\nT: Good. The accent. Intentar , we have the accent on the end. When  we put the -o, the accent is just \\nbefore it. InTENto . Now this is extremely important. If I say intentO , if I put the accent on the \\nend, it means something else. It means he tried.  Which is going to be useful for us later when we \\nlearn the past. For now, we need to think that the accent in the present tense is going on the \\npenultimate syllable. The second to last syllable. Intentar  is not present tense. It has no tense. It’s \\nthe “to” form. To try . Part of the present tense, other than putting this -o for I, is also moving the \\naccent: intento . How would you say to donate ?  \\nS: Donation -donación -donar .  \\nT: Good. Donar.  I donate . You take off the -ar and you put -o.  \\nS: Dono.   \\nT: Yes. Dono . I don’t donate or I’m not donating:   \\nS: No dono.   \\nT: Good. No dono . How was to create ?  \\nS: Crear.   \\nT: Good. Crear -creación -crear . I create:   \\nS: Creo.T: Creo . Good. Comer, comer  means to eat . So how do you say I eat or I’m eating ?  \\nS: Como.   \\nT: Como . Good. I’m going to eat:   \\nS: Voy a comer.   \\nT: Good.  Voy a comer.  The word for late in Spanish is tarde . Tarde . We know this from English as \\nwell because we have this slang in English, in British English at least, tardy . Have you ever heard \\nthat?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: Tarde.  Tarde.  So how would you say I’m going to eat late ?  \\nS: Voy a comer tarde.   \\nT: Good. Voy a comer tarde . You might have heard the word for tomorrow  as well in Spanish.  \\nMañana . So how would you say I’m going to eat tomorrow ?  \\nS: Voy a comer mañana.   \\nT: Voy a comer mañana.  Now in Spanish, if yo u have some kind of future context, something that’s \\nshowing you that you’re talking about the future, you can just use the present. You can say Voy a \\ncomer mañana  or you could just say I eat tomorrow  because you have tomorrow  showing you \\nthat you’re talki ng about the future. It’s absolutely perfect Spanish, even though it sounds a bit odd \\nin English. It’s perfect Spanish to say I eat tomorrow . There’s no problem there. So how would \\nyou say that?  \\nS: Como mañana.   \\nT: Como mañana.  So if you want to say I’m e ating with Pablo tomorrow . I’m eating with Pablo \\ntomorrow . You just say I eat with Pablo tomorrow .  \\nS: How do you say with?  \\nT: Do you remember how to say to confirm ?  \\nS: Confirmación -confirmar .T: Good. And what did that mean literally? Confirm ?  \\nS: Ah! “With signature ”.  \\nT: So what is with?  \\nS: Con firma . Con.  \\nT: Con.  Good. So, I’m eating with Pablo tomorrow:   \\nS: Como con Pablo mañana.   \\nT: Good. Como con Pablo mañana.  So we can just use the present or we can say I’m going to eat \\nwith Pablo tom orrow  and it’s the same.  \\nS: Voy a comer con Pablo mañana.   \\nT: Good.  Voy a comer con Pablo mañana.  Very good. So we are taking off our ending. We’re taking \\noff our -ar, -er or -ir and we’re adding -o to get the “I”  version. We are also accenting the \\npenult imate syllable. The syllable that comes before the last. What is to organize ?  \\nS: Organización -Organizar .  \\nT: Good. Now how do you say I organize  or I’m organizing ?  \\nS: Organizo ?  \\nT: Organizo.  Good. I will just mention for anybody trying to keep up with th e Spanish pronunciation \\nthat that z there is going to be pronounced /th/. /Organitho / in Spain. Organizo . To have  in Spanish \\nis tener . Tener.   \\nS: Tener.   \\nT: Tener.  How do you say I want to have it? I want to have it:   \\nS: Quiero tenerlo.   \\nT: Good. I’m going to have it:   \\nS: Voy a tenerlo.   \\nT: Good. I’m going to have it late:S: Voy a tenerlo tarde.   \\nT: Good! Voy a tenerlo tarde.  If you want to say later , you can say more  late and the word for more  \\nis más, m-a-s.  \\nS: Más.   \\nT: Related to massive . So h ow is later ?  \\nS: Más tarde.   \\nT: Más tarde.  Good. I’m going to have it later:   \\nS: Voy a tenerlo mas tarde.   \\nT: Good. I will tell you something that’s going to help you remember tener . Tener  is a very \\ninteresting verb, because other than to have , we can also  translate it as -tain. Contain  is contener . \\nObtain , this -tain is tener . So how would you say obtain  in Spanish, if contain  becomes contener ?  \\nS: Obtener.   \\nT: Yes! Obtener.  Sustain , this one changes a little bit. Sus-, which is s-u-s, becomes s-o-s in Spa nish.  \\nS: Sostener.   \\nT: Sostener . Sustain. Maintain. Maintain , this main  becomes man - in Spanish. So how would you \\nsay maintain ?  \\nS: Mantener.   \\nT: Mantener.  And if you heard entretener , what would you think it means? Entretener:   \\nS: Entertain.   \\nT: Yes. So it changes a little bit, but you can recognize it. Entretener . And entre  in Spanish means \\nbetween . You might hear in Spanish entre tu y yo . Between you and I . Entre tu y yo . Many \\nlanguages express this idea of possession in different ways. In English  and in Spanish, we have a \\nsimple verb: Have , tener , to express possession. But Arabic for example, you would say “at me” \\nor “with me” instead of “I have.” So it’s not a straightforward concept that all languages express \\nin the same way, this concept of po ssession. In Turkish, for example, if you want to say “I have acar” you say “My car there is.” So it’s not such a straightforward concept that we are expressing \\nin all languages in the same way, this concept of possession. Something that Spanish is alludi ng \\nto here is kind of the symbiotic relationship in ownership. When you own something, you also \\nbelong to it. You must maintain it. You must sustain it. You must contain it. It’s a symbiotic \\nrelationship. You don’t just own things. You are also owned by th em. To have  is tener . And you \\nalso get these other verbs that you can use. Obtener , contener , mantener , sostener , entretener .  \\nI have  is tengo . What happened here? What should it be?  \\nS: Teno.   \\nT: Yes. That’s what it should be. But it’s irregular. It has a  g popping up. But the nice thing about the \\nirregular verbs in Spanish is that we can group them together. There’s always a little group of verbs \\nthat do thing s in the same way. For example, what was to come ?  \\nS: Venir.   \\nT: Venir. Very good. Now venir  behaves like tener  when it makes the I form. So if tener  becomes \\ntengo , venir  might become…  \\nS: Vengo.   \\nT: Vengo ! Good. So I come  is vengo . It’s irregular. But we’ve already noticed two verbs that have \\nthis same pattern of irregularity. And to think of them together helps us. Now if you want to say I  \\nwill come tomorrow , we don’t know the word for will, but we don’t need it. Because tomorrow  is \\nour future context. What is the word for tomorrow ?  \\nS: Mañana .  \\nT: Good. So I’m coming tomorrow:   \\nS: Vengo  mañana.   \\nT: Vengo  mañana.  Very good.',\n",
       " 'Track 11  \\nT: So we saw how our “to\" form of the verb : to come, to eat, to tolerate . How would to tolerate  be?  \\nS: Toleration -toleración -tolerar.   \\nT: Exactly, tolerar . Good. So our “to” form ends with an r and it\\'s always  going to be -ar, -er or -ir. \\nAnd we had an example of each. And we notice  that for -ar, -ir and -er verbs, unless the verb is \\nirregular, we will take off that ending and put on an -o to get the “ I” version, to say I tolerate  for \\nexample. So how would you say I tolerate ?  \\nS: Tolero ?  \\nT: Good. And you moved the accent back as well, which is essential for the present tense. Very good. \\nIf you said toleró , it would mean he tolerated , which as I mentioned, will be useful for us later \\nwhen we learn this tense. Bu t it\\'s important in the present tense to have the accent on the \\npenultimate syllable. Tolero . What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer.   \\nT: And what is I eat?  \\nS: Comero.   \\nT: So you don\\'t add on the o, you take off the ending  – and then you put:   \\nS: Oh yes, como .  \\nT: Como.  Good. This also means how or like, by coincidence. You might have heard cómo estás? - \\nHow are you?  But como  is also I eat. So for all verbs, we take of f the ending and we add -o and \\nwe get the “ I” version. But for the rest of the versions, for he, she, it, you ( formal), for we, etc., the \\nverbs split into two groups. Although we have three different endings, we have two groups. Now \\nmost verbs in Spanish are -ar verbs. This is the biggest group. The group of -ar verbs, the verbs \\nthat end -ar. In fact any new verb that comes into Spanish will become, will be crowned, as an -ar \\nverb. So to give you some examples - tuitear . What do you think that means?  \\nS: To Twitter .T: To tweet , yes, tuitear . Facebookear , yes this exis ts. Googlear .  \\nS: Excellent.  \\nT: So there is something in the mental lexicon, in the mental dictionary that is saying there can be no \\nmore -er/-ir verbs. These are a historic group, the door is closed. So we have two groups. So for -ar, \\n-er, -ir, if the verb is regular we take off the ending  -ar, -er, -ir, and we put -o and we get the “ I” \\nversion. Now for the others, the other versions, there\\'s a slight difference between -ar verbs and -\\ner/-ir verbs. Now -ar verbs have the vowel /ah/ as a principl e sound, as a sound that keeps popping \\nup. So, for example, to eliminate . How is to eliminate ?  \\nS: Elimination -eliminación -eliminar .  \\nT: Good. Eliminar . So if you want to say I eliminate  or I delete , how would it be? Think syllable by \\nsyllable. If you thin k of it all together it\\'s quite confusing here because you have quite a few vowels.  \\nS: Elimino ?  \\nT: Good. You see when you take your time to divide actually the word piece by piece, it\\'s much more \\ndigestible. Elimino . Good. Now for he, she, it and you (formal) - we have learned that these group \\ntogether in Spanish - we just use an a on the ending. So how would that be? He deletes  or \\neliminates,  she/he/you  (formal).  \\nS: Elimina.   \\nT: Good. And we still have the accent on the penultimate syllable, elimina . Very good. How do you \\nthink you would say to last  like “it lasts a long time\" or something like this? It\\'s not obvious \\nthrough the word last, but maybe we find something through Latin that helps us work out how to \\nsay that: “a period of time”, sometimes  we call it duration , no?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: So how would that be in Spanish?  \\nS: Duración.   \\nT: So to las t might actually come from this. If it did, how would it sound?  \\nS: Durar.T: Yes. And this is the verb, durar . A lot  is much  in Spanish; it\\'s mucho . So if  you want to say it lasts \\na long time  you can just say it lasts much .  \\nS: Durar mucho.   \\nT: This is to last , durar . So how would it lasts  be? So…  \\nS: Dura mucho.   \\nT: So you might be talking about a show or movie. How would you say it doesn\\'t last a long tim e?  \\nS: No dura mucho.   \\nT: Good. No dura mucho.  How do you say exaggeration ? Exa /juh-juh/, exaggeration ?  \\nS: Exageración.   \\nT: Exageración. To exaggerate:   \\nS: Exagerar.   \\nT: Yeah. So how would you say I exaggerate ?  \\nS: Exagero.   \\nT: He\\'s exaggerating , or she\\'s exaggerating or you-  \\nS: Exagera.   \\nT: Good. Exagera.  He\\'s not exaggerating, she\\'s not exaggerating, you ( formal)  are not exaggerating:   \\nS: No exagera.   \\nT: Good.  No exagera. Good.  Did you ever hear the word mastication  in English?  \\nS: Masticación.   \\nT: D id you ever hear it though?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: I didn\\'t. I mean this is a word -  \\nS: It’s chewing .T: Yes. So how do you think to chew  would be?  \\nS: Masticar.   \\nT: Masticar  is to chew . Now I didn\\'t know this word actually and this will happen to many English \\nspeakers as well. You will be able to work out many English words that you didn\\'t know before \\nthrough Spanish. So this was the way round it worked for me. Because I found masticar  first, and \\nthen I saw in English somewhere mastication . So it can work that way round as well which is \\nuseful. Another example is morder , which means to bite . I learned this in Spanish, and then I saw \\nin some novel I was reading, mordent . Oh ok that means biting . You can increase your English \\nvocabulary and what you understand in English just through the Latin that you learn in Spanish. \\nSo if masticar  is to chew, how would you say I chew ?  \\nS: Mastico.   \\nT: Mastico. Good. And he chews or she chews, it chews, you ( formal) chew ?  \\nS: Mastica.   \\nT: Mastica. Good. Now this is our key sound , this / a/ sound. Now we can add on different sounds to \\nthis / a/ to get other versions. So for example, if we add on an n to this / a/, we get they and we get \\nyou (plural). So in English like you guys , you all . So how would you say collaboration ?  \\nS: Colabo ración.   \\nT: Colaboración. To collaborate:   \\nS: Colaborar.   \\nT: Good. I collaborate:   \\nS: Colaboro.   \\nT: Good. Colaboro.  He/she/it/you ( formal):  \\nS: Colabora.   \\nT: Colabora. You can add on to this an n and you get they or you (plural). So how would it be?  \\nS: Colaboran.T: Colaboran. Good. Hablar  is to speak  in Spanish. Hablar . It\\'s spelled h-a-b-l-a-r. What\\'s \\nhappening with that h?  \\nS: It\\'s silent.  \\nT: Totally silent. Hablar . How do you say I speak ?  \\nS: Hablo.   \\nT: So hablo  is I speak or I am speaking . Habla  is-  \\nS: He/she/it or the formal.  \\nT: Good. You formal. So what would it mean if I said no hablan con Pablo ?  \\nS: They\\'re not speaking with Pablo.   \\nT: Good. They\\'re not speaking with Pablo or they don\\'t speak with Pablo . Good. How would you say \\nI want to speak ?  \\nS: Quiero hablar.   \\nT: How would you say I\\'m going to speak ? Think of to go on a voyage.  \\nS: Ah, voy.  \\nT: Good .  \\nS: Yes. Voy hablar.   \\nT: Now I\\'m not sure, because hablar  starts with /a/, I\\'m not sure if you put the a to connect them.  \\nDid you?  \\nS: Oh, no I didn\\'t. Voy a hablar.   \\nT: And when you speak quickly, it will kind of blend together. Voy a hablar.  Maybe it\\'s a fraction \\nlonger, voy a hablar , but it will stick together like this. Good. Now, if we go back to this he/she/it  \\nform, habla , and we add an  s, we get the you (informal).  \\nS: Hablas.T: So this is speaking to one person informally. Hablas . When we have one of these little words: te, \\nme, lo, los, la, las, they will come before the changed verb. So the changed verb is the one that \\nisn\\'t ending in r anymore. They will come before this verb. So if we have quiero , I want , and we \\nwant to say I want it,  that it must come before the verb. So how would it be?  \\nS: Lo quiero.   \\nT: But that little word can also go after the complete verb. If we say somethi ng like I want to see it,  \\nwe end up actually having an option where we put that it. But it doesn\\'t matter; there\\'s no change \\nin meaning. It\\'s exactly the same, you just have the option.  \\nSo what was to see , which was related to English view?  \\nS: Ver?  \\nT: So if you want to say I want to see it  or I want to see him?   \\nS: So it\\'s quiero verlo .  \\nT: Quiero verlo.   \\nS: Or lo quiero ver .  \\nT: Yeah you have the option. Lo quiero ver . But if you have one changed verb all by itself, you don\\'t \\nhave the option; it must go  before. You might say it\\'s important to speak about it . Now you don\\'t \\nneed to say about  in Spanish, we\\'re going to say to speak it  and that\\'s understood to speak about \\nit. So here, in that clause and that bit, to speak about it is only to speak . So h ow would you say it\\'s \\nimportant to speak about it  or literally, it\\'s important to speak it?   \\nS: Es importante hablarlo.   \\nT: Good. So how was I must or I owe, which is related to the English word debt?  \\nS: Debo.   \\nT: So I must invite him:   \\nS: Debo invita rlo.  \\nT: Or?S: Lo debo invitar.   \\nT: Good. So that\\'s the deal with these little words, where we can put them. Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 12  \\nT: So, we\\'re looking at -ar verbs and how they work, and we are changing them for the different \\npeople. Let\\'s make a recap . How would you say to contaminate ?  \\nS: Contaminar.   \\nT: Good. So how would you say it\\'s contaminating ?  \\nS: Contamina.   \\nT: Good. So our key vowel for -ar verbs is / a/. That\\'s our key vowel. We add a n to get you guys or \\nthey contaminate . So how would that b e?  \\nS: Contaminan.   \\nT: And we add an s to the he/she/it form to get the you (informal). So you (informal) contaminate  \\nwould be :  \\nS: Contaminas.   \\nT: Now for -er/-ir verbs, for -er/-ir verbs, their key sound is / e/. For this closed group of historic \\nverbs,  their key sound is / e/. So, what do you think vender  means? Vender . What do you think \\nthat means?  \\nS: Does it have anything to do with vent and ventilation ?  \\nT: No it\\'s not a t, it\\'s a d.  \\nS: Oh vending . Vending machine ?  \\nT: Yeah. Good. So what does it  mean then, vender ? What does a vending machine do? It\\'s a selling \\nmachine. Or you might have heard street vender  as well. So I sell  or I\\'m selling:   \\nS: Vendo.   \\nT: I\\'m selling it:   \\nS: Lo vendo ?  \\nT: Good. Is there anywhere else you can put that lo? Do you  have the option here?S: Well, we can put it at the end if it\\'s in its vender  state.  \\nT: Exactly. So no, we can\\'t put it anywhere else. It has to go there. Lo vendo . How would you say \\nI\\'m selling them ?  \\nS: Lo vendas.   \\nT: It\\'s very important when you’re m aking -  \\nS: Véndolo. Las . Oh. Sorry.  \\nT: It\\'s very important  when you\\'re building the sentence that you take your time to understand who\\'s \\ndoing what. Ah? So I sell , it’s me doing the selling. So  I\\'m selling them , the first bit you want to \\nwork out is  I\\'m selling . What\\'s that?  \\nS: Vendo.   \\nT: Good. And then you want to work out them . I sell  is vendo . I sell them  is?  \\nS: Los vendo.   \\nT: Los vendo.  Good. So this process of dividing it into two thoughts, just doing that is going to make \\nsure that you don\\'t kind of get this salad. Many times, you will just switch them, and you want to \\nsay she has them  but you will say they have her . You know, so it\\'s very important to take your \\ntime to think about those bits separately. If you\\'re talking about feminine t hings like I sell the \\nhouses , how would it be? So it\\'s still them  we\\'re going to say, but we mean feminine things. I sell \\nthem:   \\nS: Las vendo.   \\nT: Very good. Las vendo.  If you want to say actually I sell  or I am selling the houses , the word for \\nthe, we sai d was la. La casa also becomes plural.  \\nS: Las.  \\nT: Yes. And the word casa also becomes plural.  \\nS: Casas.   \\nT: So I am selling the houses:S: Vendo las casas ?  \\nT: Yeah. I\\'m selling the houses , vendo las casas , or I\\'m selling them and you mean the hou ses:  \\nS: Las vendo.   \\nT: Las vendo. Good. The reason why we\\'re looking at this with objects is because many people, when \\nthey\\'re learning Spanish, they remember to change gender for people , but they kind of put all things \\nin with lo and los and we kind of w ant to get out of that habit before it starts. So we imagine the \\nhouses, we refer to them as las.  \\nS: Is there a rule for which objects are female and which are not?  \\nT: Well remember it\\'s not strictly the object that has the gender, but the word, the noun  in itself. So \\nfeminine words end in a. Words that end in a, with a few exceptions, are feminine words. So casa \\nis feminine: la casa . And it takes la. Then there are other feminine endings. So -ión is a feminine \\nending. The administration is la administrac ión. All of these words are going to be la.  \\nThe opinion  is?  \\nS: La opinión .  \\nT: La opinión . The association:   \\nS: La asociación .  \\nT: Good. The celebration:   \\nS: La celebración.   \\nT: La celebración. Good. If a word ends in -ity in Engl ish, it\\'s going to be -idad  in Spanish most of \\nthe time. This -idad  is a feminine ending as well. So that shows us that all of these words are \\nfeminine words. So for example you have diversity . You change that -ity to -idad . -idad .  \\nS: Diversidad.   \\nT: Good . Diversidad . The diversity:   \\nS: La diversidad.   \\nT: La diversidad.  Good. The nationality:S: La nacionalidad.   \\nT: La nacionalidad. The same happens with the -tion, it becomes like an s or a /th/ in most of Spain. \\nLa na/s/ionalidad, la na/th/ionalidad, you  could hear either. The creativity:   \\nS: La creatividad.   \\nT: Very well pronounced. You thought of the vowels very well. La creatividad . The electricity :  \\nS: La electricidad.   \\nT: La electricidad. These words are very nice as well for guessing other words. Be cause if you have \\nthis rule, electricity  becomes electricidad , you can assume that electric  is probably the same in \\nSpanish as well, just sounding more Spanish or having a small change. Even though there\\'s no rule \\nfor that, you can assume it. So how do you  think you would say electric?  \\nS: ElecTRIC .  \\nT: Does it sound Spanish enough yet?  \\nS: ElecTRIco .  \\nT: Yeah eLECtrico .  \\nS: Eléctrico .  \\nT: Eléctrico . How would you say generosity ?  \\nS: Generosidad.   \\nT: Very good . Gener osidad. How do you think you will say generous ? Have a play with it.  \\nS: Gener …  \\nT: Have a play with it and see what sits nice.  \\nS: Generoso.   \\nT: Yes. Generoso.  Generoso. For males. For females what do you think it would become?  \\nS: Generosa.T: Generosa.  Exactly. How lo becomes la, generoso  becomes generosa . It also can become plural \\nas well if we’re talking about more than one person, male or mixed group, how would it sound?  \\nS: Generosos.   \\nT: Good. And if I was just speaking about females?  \\nS: Generosas .  \\nT: Very good. Community:   \\nS: Comunidad.   \\nT: The community:   \\nS: La comunidad.   \\nT: La comunidad. Feminine word , feminine ending. How do you think you would say common ?  \\nCommon  comes from community , by the way.  \\nS: Is it cómono ? Comono .  \\nT: Común.   \\nS: Ah.  \\nT: So there’s no way to know that.  \\nS: Comuno  or Común ?  \\nT: Común.   \\nS: Común.   \\nT: Común , with the accent on the end. So there\\'s no way to know that. You will get -  \\nS: It\\'s irregular?  \\nT: There\\'s no rule here so there\\'s no irregularity. So maybe y ou will take comuno  and somebody \\nwould give you that feedback of común . And then you would realize. But if you didn\\'t take that \\nguess, you wouldn\\'t get the word. We will learn a lot of vocabulary very quickly this way.How would you say opportunity ?  \\nS: Oportunidad.   \\nT: Oportunidad.  How do you think you would say opportune ? Opportune , you know we use this \\nword in English like timely  or convenient . Opportune:   \\nS: Oportuna ?  \\nT: Oportuno.  Or if you are talking about a feminine thing, oportuna . Clarity:   \\nS: Claridad.   \\nT: Claridad. And clear  comes from clarity . So you can look at claridad  and you can probably guess \\nhow to say clear .  \\nS: Clear ?  \\nT: But look at the Spanish word. Claridad.   \\nS: Clarido.   \\nT: And the -idad  is the ending isn\\'t it?  \\nS: Oh yes, claro .  \\nT: Yes, claro . So this is another good skill. When you\\'re guessing, you want to get rid of the ending. \\nThis ending -idad  is what\\'s making it a noun. La claridad . Claro . And claro  is used a lot \\nconversationally. Other than meaning “clear” as an adjectiv e, it can also be used like “of course\". \\nClaro, claro, claro.  You will hear this a lot in conversation to show agreement or understanding \\nof what you\\'ve said. Claro.  Personality:   \\nS: Personalidad.   \\nT: Personalidad. So we can assume that person  is probably the same in Spanish as well. When I say \\n“the same\", I mean similar.  \\nS: So again it\\'s guessing. It could be -T: Exactly. So what do you think it sounds like? You will develop an intuition, especially through \\nlistening. This is why listening is important a s well because this is what will really develop your \\nintuition. Because you might have heard it before and not realized it.  \\nS: I\\'ve heard of persona , so I\\'m guessing it\\'s persono .  \\nT: It\\'s persona .  \\nS: Oh persona.   \\nT: It\\'s persona . It\\'s a feminine word. S o remember it\\'s the word that\\'s feminine or masculine, not the \\nthing. So I am a persona , even though I am a man. The word is feminine, not me. Sincerity:   \\nS: Sinceridad.   \\nT: Sinceridad. Sincere:   \\nS: Sencero.   \\nT: Sincero.   \\nS: Sincero.   \\nT: Sincero. So that\\'s  another example of a feminine ending. If it ends -idad , it\\'s a feminine ending. \\nAll of these words without exception are la. If it ends -ión, that\\'s a feminine ending. All of these \\nwords without exception s go with la. Back to vender . How was I sell ?  \\nS: Vendo.   \\nT: I want to sell:   \\nS: Quiero vender.   \\nT: Quiero vender.  Good. I want to sell it:   \\nS: Quiero venderlo.   \\nT: Quiero venderlo.  Where else could we put that lo?  \\nS: Lo quiero vender.T: Good. The -er/-ir verbs use as their principal sound /e/. So whilst -ar verbs use the principle sound \\n/a/, and we got organizar  and then organiza , for - what does that mean, organiza ?  \\nS: He/she  or it or you (formal).  \\nT: Good. So organiza , /a/ is a principal sound. Organizan  means? When we ad d an n what does it \\nmean?  \\nS: They.   \\nT: They organize . Or?  \\nS: You ( plural).  \\nT: You ( plural). So we add the n and we get they and you guys. Organizan . We add the s and we get \\nyou (informal), organizas . So /a/ is our key sound for -ar verbs, and for -er/-ir verbs, our key \\nsound is /e/. So to get he/she/it and you formal, we\\'ll take off our ending and put on /e/. He sells, \\nshe sells, it sells, you  (formal) sell:  \\nS: Vende.   \\nT: Vende. How would you say he sells it  or she sells it ?  \\nS: Lo vende.   \\nT: Good. Lo v ende. Lo vende. We said that the word for something was algo, algo. So you can say \\nhe\\'s selling something , she\\'s selling something , you\\'re selling something .  \\nS: Vende algo.   \\nT: Good. Vende algo. Good. What do you think we would add on to vende  to get the they form or \\nthe you (plural) form?  \\nS: Venden.   \\nT: So we\\'re doing actually the same. So we have a key vowel sound, which is /e/. But then the rest, \\nwe\\'re doing the same what we did with the -ar verbs. Venden . They sell . They\\'re not selling:   \\nS: No venden.   \\nT: They\\'re not selling it:S: No lo venden.   \\nT: Why aren\\'t they selling it?:   \\nS: ¿Por qué no lo venden?   \\nT: Good. ¿Por qué no lo venden?  Why aren\\'t they selling it to me ?, you just say why aren\\'t they \\nselling me it ? You put the personal one, me, first. The one that refers to the person it goes first.  \\nYou just say why aren\\'t they selling me it ? So they are selling . How is they are selling ?  \\nS: Venden.   \\nT: Venden. They are selling it:   \\nS: Lo venden.   \\nT: Good. They are selling me it.  So they c ome together and the personal one comes first.  \\nS: Me lo venden.   \\nT: Me lo venden. So whilst we have this complicated stuff happening in English, they sell it to me , \\nno, in Spanish we\\'re just going to identify it\\'s it and it\\'s me, me is the personal one so  it\\'s going to \\ncome first, me lo venden.  They\\'re selling it to me.  They\\'re not selling it to me , or they don\\'t sell it \\nto me:   \\nS: No me lo venden.   \\nT: No me lo venden. Why don\\'t they sell it to me?   \\nS: ¿Por qué no me lo venden?   \\nT: Very good. The word for us is nos. Nos, the word for us. So how would you say they are selling \\nus something ? So something , you know algo, is not one of these little words like me, lo, nos. It\\'s \\ngoing to come afterwards. So  they are selling us something:   \\nS: Nos venden algo.   \\nT: V ery good. Nos venden algo. But if instead of saying they\\'re selling us something and you just \\nwanted to say they\\'re selling us it , they\\'re selling it to us, they\\'re selling us it.  How would it be?S: Nos lo venden.   \\nT: Good. Nos lo venden. Good. So there you have an us, you have an it, you have a they. It could be \\nlike hugely complicated, no, if you just took that all as a package and tried to translate it. But \\nthinking about the verb first and then you’re thinking about the other bits you need to put, the n \\nyou get the sentence that you want, confident that you have the sentence that you want. How would \\nyou say they\\'re not selling it to us ?  \\nS: No nos lo venden.   \\nT: Good. No nos lo venden. Why don\\'t they sell it to us?   \\nS: ¿Por qué no nos lo venden?   \\nT: Good. ¿Por qué no nos lo venden?  Very good.',\n",
       " 'Track 13  \\nT: To do , or to make  in Spanish is hacer . And it has a silent h. It\\'s h-a-c-e-r. So in most of Spain \\nactually that would sound ha/th/er . But ha/s/er  in most of the Spanish speaking world. What  verb \\ntype is it? What is the ending?  \\nS: -er.  \\nT: -er verb. So actually whenever we come across a new verb, we want to make a mental note what \\nis the ending. Or, rather than make a mental note, just process it. Remember we always want to do \\nanything but m emorize, so just looking and going “ hacer , -er verb, ok”. Just to get in that habit. \\nIf we know it\\'s an -er verb, we know how to work with it. So how would you say he\\'s doing or \\nmaking, she is doing or making, you are (formal)  doing or making ?  \\nS: Hace.   \\nT: Hace. Good. You\\'re doing it:   \\nS: Lo hace.   \\nT: Lo hace. How would you say they\\'re doing it or you guys are doing it ?  \\nS: Los hacen. Lo hacen.   \\nT: Very good. Very good. Lo hacen.  You (informal ) are doing it.  So what is the sound for informal \\nyou?  \\nS: Hacen.  \\nT: So for informal you we add on an s to the he/she/it  version. So we get:  \\nS: Haces.   \\nT: You\\'re doing it:   \\nS: Lo haces.   \\nT: Good. The word for what  in Spanish is qué. How do you say what are you doing?   \\nS: ¿Qué haces ?T: ¿Qué haces ? And this is a way of saying how are you  as well. ¿Qué haces ?, what are you doing ?, \\nwhat are you up to ? Good. So we see that for -ar verbs, we have the principle sound of / a/, and \\nthen we add our n or s, n for they or you (plural), and s for informal you. And fo r -er/-ir verbs we \\nhave the key sound / e/, and we\\'re adding on s for informal you, n for they, you (plural). Now these \\nassociations between s and informal you, and n and they or you guys , we\\'re going to see all \\nthroughout the Spanish verb structure.  \\nS: So  this confuses me a little bit; isn\\'t this also a memorization? Having to remember which ending \\ngoes with what people?  \\nT: There\\'s a difference between memorization and remembering, ah? We can remember through not \\nactively trying to memorize. So not telling you you shouldn\\'t remember anything, you need to \\nremember Spanish. I\\'m telling you that you\\'re going to remember it much easier without the active \\nprocess of trying to memorize anything, which blocks whichever processes we need for \\nremembering. I l ike to describe it in this way: that you borrow information when you memorize it, \\nbut when you are applying it practically in this construction of these sentences, when you\\'re \\nlooking from many different angles at the elements that we are looking at in Spa nish, then you are \\ninternalizing it. Then it\\'s really yours, you\\'re not borrowing it. Puedo  in Spanish means I can, I am \\nable. Puedo.   \\nS: Puedo.   \\nT: Good. P-u-e-d-o. Puedo.   \\nS: Puedo.   \\nT: You\\'re probably noticing as well that the d is quite soft whe n it comes in the middle of a word in \\nSpanish, rather than a hard / d/. Puedo.   \\nS: Puedo.   \\nT: So puedo  means I can , or I am able , and the “to\" form of the verb is an -er verb. So puedo  is an -er \\nverb. So how would you say he can or she can or it can or you (formal) can?  \\nS: Puede.   \\nT: And how would you say informally you can ?S: Puedes.   \\nT: Good. Now in English, we don\\'t say can you to come ?, but it\\'s what we mean. Now this is an \\nEnglish problem; the English is taking the to away here; it does it some times. You don\\'t say I must \\nto come , you say I must come , no? It\\'s like I am able to come . You can think of it this way as we \\nthought of I must come  as I owe to come . So how would you say can you come?  Talking \\ninformally?  \\nS: Puede - sorry, informa l. ¿Puedes venir?   \\nT: ¿Puedes venir? So this is what we\\'re going to be using to talk with friends, no, this s. We\\'re going \\nto be hearing it a lot. If it helps you make the association, you might have heard ¿cómo estás ?, \\nhow are you?  The s on the end o f estás  there is this informal s. Puedes . So, can\\'t you come? :  \\nS: ¿No puedes venir?   \\nT: ¿No puedes venir? Why can\\'t you come? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no puedes venir?   \\nT: ¿Por qué no puedes venir? I want to know why you can\\'t come :  \\nS: Quiero  - oh to know. Ok I\\'m g oing know  and knowledge  and that\\'s not taking me anywhere.  \\nT: Boy\\'s got savvy …  \\nS: Ah, yes.  \\nT: So I want to know :  \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: Quiero saber . Why:  \\nS: Por qué.  \\nT: You can’t come :  \\nS: No puedes venir.T: Very good. Very good. If you address ea ch part, part by part, and apply all of our mental energy \\njust to the part we need and then forget it. Quiero saber por  qué no puedes venir. Very good.  \\nSo to recap, we have -ar verbs and we have -er/-ir verbs. For all of the verbs, we take off the \\nending,  -ar, -er, -ir, and we put -o for the “I” version. So vender  is to sell and I sell  is:  \\nS: Vendo.   \\nT: Vendo. Comprar  is to buy and I buy is:  \\nS: Compro.   \\nT: Compro. Good. Llegar  is to arrive . Llegar . And I arrive is:  \\nS: Llegaro ...oh llego .  \\nT: Llego. Good . So with this rule we can take any verb and we can do this if it\\'s regular. Maybe it\\'s \\nirregular and we try it and we make a mistake. So for example, salir  is to leave or to go out . If we \\napply this rule, what are we going to come up with?  \\nS: Salo.   \\nT: But it\\'s wrong; it\\'s salgo . So it\\'s one of those -go instead of -o like vengo , I\\'m coming:   \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo , I have ; salgo , I leave, I\\'m going out . The quite common verbs, we tend to find in all \\nlanguages that the most common verbs are the most irregula r. Esperar , esperar , means to wait \\nand to hope . Which is interesting and it\\'s accurate enough. I mean you\\'re not doing much more \\nthan waiting when you hope. We have it in the word desperate  actually. Des- is un-, and you\\'re \\nhopeless when you\\'re desperate. So esperar  is to wait or to hope . How do you say I\\'m waiting , or \\nI\\'m hoping , or I wait , or I hope ?  \\nS: Espero.   \\nT: Espero.  Now how do you say he waits ?  \\nS: Espere .T: I\\'m really glad you made that mistake actually. Because it\\'s a wonderful point to elabor ate on. \\nBefore we touch a verb, we want to take one split -second to go esperar:  -ar verb. Otherwise what \\nhappens? Our brain hears / e/-/e/ from esperar , and it wants to put an / e/. What your mind is doing \\nthere, putting an e because you have espe- and it fi ts better, is actually even ingrained in other \\nlanguages. For example, in Turkish you have something called vowel harmony. And when you\\'re \\nadding on suffixes, there\\'s like two or four, depending on the suffix, two or four different versions \\nof that suffix that you can add on so it can agree with the vowel before. So there\\'s something in \\nyour mind that would prefer an e there. Of course because it\\'s espe- and like I said you even see \\nthis formalized in other languages, like in this phenomenon of vowel harmon y. So to stop that \\nprocess from happening, you must run back to the “to” form and then you take control.  \\nS: Espera.   \\nT: Espera.  And espera  means he/she/it/you  (formal) wait or are waiting, is waiting . We can build \\nthe rest. So how do you say they wait ?  \\nS: Esperan.   \\nT: If you want to say they\\'re waiting for me , we don\\'t need the word for for, it\\'s just like they await \\nme. We don\\'t need the word for for. So how do you say they await me ?  \\nS: Esperanme  - sorry, me esperan.   \\nT: The only option there because it \\'s a changed verb. Me esperan.  They\\'re not waiting for me :  \\nS: No me esperan.   \\nT: Good. No me esperan.  I want to know why they\\'re not waiting for me. I want to know :  \\nS: Quiero saber.   \\nT: Why:   \\nS: Por qué no me esperan.   \\nT: Very good. Quiero saber por  qué no me esperan.  Well done.  \\nS: I was just very happy that I remembered saver  finally.  \\nT: Ah good. Saber  though with a b.S: Saber , ah.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Isn\\'t it from savvy ?  \\nT: Yeah there is a grey area between v and b. So it will change between language s. Actually a very \\nnice example of this is the word for vocabulary . Vocabulary  in Spanish is vocabulario . \\nVocabulario.  It\\'s spelled with a v. But the word for mouth  in Spanish is boca , spelled with a b. \\nNow of course vocabulario  is coming from boca . Your v ocabulary is your “mouth -ulary\". This \\ngives us another rule, actually. Words ending -ary will become -ario. So necessary :  \\nS: Necesario.   \\nT: Contrary :  \\nS: Contrario.   \\nT: Good.',\n",
       " \"Track 14  \\nT: What was to know ?  \\nS: Saber.   \\nT: Saber. Good. What would I kno w be, if it follows our rules?  \\nS: Sabo.   \\nT: But it’s not. It’s sé. So it’s an exception. S-e, sé. You might have heard lo sé, lo sé - literally I know \\nit. Because sé by itself is a bit short , so you often hear people saying lo sé, lo sé  - I know it , rather \\nthan sé, sé, sé . So this is irregular, very irregular. S-e. But the rest of the versions of saber  are \\nregular. So how would you say he knows or she knows or it knows or you (formal) know ?  \\nS: Sabe.   \\nT: Good. So I don't know :  \\nS: No sé.   \\nT: No sé. We said that quiero  was I want , and quiero  actually is an -er verb so how would you say I \\ndon't know what he wants ? What is what ?  \\nS: Qué. No sé qué lo quiere.   \\nT: Why lo?  \\nS: He.  \\nT: Firstly, you're not using the word for he, you're just saying he wa nts and that's contained in the \\nverb. But lo is not he, it's him. Not he. We didn't learn yet the word for he. On purpose actually we \\nhaven't been learning these words so that we can just use the verb for now.  \\nS: Ok .  \\nT: So try again: I don't know what he  wants.   \\nS: No sé qué quiere .T: Good, you must feel comfortable with two words becoming one. I don't know what he wants , no \\nsé qué quiere . Good. The word for he is él, él. E-l. If you want to be emphatic: I don't know what \\nHE wants, or if yo u want to show or clarify who you're talking about, you can add that. So how \\nwould you do that? I don't know what he wants :  \\nS: No sé qué él quiere.   \\nT: Good. No sé qué él quiere. Or you can say no sé qué quiere él . You can do either; one sou nds \\nmore emphatic than the other , and this is much better understood in live practice. Because the \\nemphasis is n't just in the sentence, it's with the hands and facial expression and tone of voice. So \\nit's something much better to get live. No sé qué él quiere, no sé qué quiere él.   \\nThe word for she, what is the word for her first? We want to differentiate. What is the word for \\nher, like in I want to see her ? How would you say I want to see, to view, her ?  \\nS: Quiero verla.   \\nT: Good. Quiero verla. But if you want to say she sees , it's not her, I want to see her , it's she. And \\nthe word for she is ella. Ella.  \\nS: Ella.   \\nT: Now this is spelled e-l-l-a. Double l in Spanish is pronounced /yuh/. Ella. So if you want to say \\nshe sees, to see is a verb, what type of verb is it? -ar verb, -ir verb, -er verb?  \\nS: Ver. It's an -er.  \\nT: An -er verb. It seems to o obvious to us.  \\nS: Sorry I thought you might be asking something more complicated.  \\nT: No. This is an -er verb. So how do I say she sees ?  \\nS: Ella ve.   \\nT: Ella ve. And if I know who I'm talking about I can just say ve. Maybe when we are contrasting in \\nthe sentence we have a special desire to use these words. When I say contrasting, I mean in the \\nsense maybe I say I want to invite him, but s he doesn't want to invite him . So even if we know who \\nI'm talking about, there I will probably use the word for she because I'm making that contrast.Again these are things you just do very naturally without realizing it once you get practicing. Also \\nbecau se your native language probably does the same thing as well. Even if you don't have the \\nchoice whether or not to put she - like in English  you always put it - you will stress it with your \\nvoice. I don't want to invite him , but SHE does. So because y ou are stressing that with your voice \\nin English, that's also going to carry over. Many things are going to carry over that are positive \\nlanguage transfer that we might not necessarily address specifically. So how would you say that? \\nI don't want to invite  him, but she does want to invite him. So, I don't want:   \\nS: No quiero.   \\nT: To invite him :  \\nS: Invitarlo.   \\nT: Good. No quiero invitarlo. But:  \\nS: Pero.   \\nT: Pero.  She does . So actually we can just say but she yes . What was the word for yes?  \\nS: Sí.  \\nT: Sí. So we can just say but she yes . How would you do that?  \\nS: Pero ella sí.   \\nT: Good. No quiero invitarlo, pero ella sí.  Or maybe I even use the word for I there to be emphatic. \\nYo no quiero invitarlo.  Yo: y-o. Yo no quiero invitarlo, pero ella sí.   \\nSo we sai d that salir was to leave or to go out . Now, I leave or I go out is salgo . It's irregular, has \\nthe /g/ sound popping up. Salgo . But the rest of the versions are regular , so let's make them. How \\ndo you say he goes out or he leaves ?  \\nS: Sele?  \\nT: Again you'r e making some Turkish vowel harmony here.  \\nS: Sorry, what's the to?  \\nT: Salir .S: So it's seli- No  \\nT: Salir.   \\nS: Sale.   \\nT: Sale. Good. So that sele you put before is because it just sounds better. The mind has some kind \\nof desire for this vowel harmony. It's very interesting. Sale.  Now you can make me the rest.  \\nThey , or you (plural), you guys:    \\nS: Salen.   \\nT: And you (informal):  \\nS: Sales.   \\nT: Sales. Good. Now if you want to say I'm going out to eat , how is I'm going out again? So it should \\nbe salo but it was:  \\nS: Sango ?  \\nT: Salgo.   \\nS: Salgo.   \\nT: Salgo.  So the irregularity is the same as the other ones that we saw: tener , tengo : to have, I have ; \\nvenir,  vengo : to come , I come ; salir , salgo . So how do you say I'm going out to eat ?  \\nS: I'm not sure of the word out.  \\nT: This is the verb. The verb is  to leave or to go out .  \\nS: Oh, salgo . Right .  \\nT: So you don't need the word for out.  \\nS: Ok. Salgo comer. Salgo a comer.   \\nT: Why did you think of the a? I think you felt it. You felt that sense of movement . Good. So salgo a \\ncomer , it's a verb of movement. Good. Voy a comer , I'm going to eat . Salgo a comer , I'm going \\nout to eat . Very good. What was I have ?S: Tengo.   \\nT: Tengo. I have it :  \\nS: Lo tengo.   \\nT: Lo tengo. Good. I have them :  \\nS: Los tengo.   \\nT: Los tengo. Good. If we add on que to tengo , and there's not really any comfortable translation for \\nthis, but if we add on que we get I have to , in the sense of must , have to . So for example if you say \\ntengo que comer  you get I have to eat . So we change the mea ning of tengo : like  have , which is \\njust possession, to have to  by adding que. Like I said there is no comfortable translation. Que is \\nwhat  or that, it's also used as that. We're going to use it like this later, but again it's still very \\nuncomfortable to t ranslate. So we will just say we add que and we get the meaning of have to . So \\nhow would you say I have to do it ? What was to do ? Begins with a silent h:  \\nS: Hacer.   \\nT: Hacer. So I have to do it :  \\nS: Tengo que hacer. Hacerlo.   \\nT: Good. Tengo que hacerlo , lo tengo que hacer , you have the option. So we've seen a few verbs \\nwith this -go business. Vengo , I'm coming ; tengo , I have ; salgo , I leave ; and we've seen that the -go \\njust pops up for the “I” version. It doesn't pop up for the other versio ns, this g. So, tiene  for \\nexample is he has . Tiene . How would you say they have ?  \\nS: Tienen.   \\nT: Tienen. And how would you say you have , speaking informally?  \\nS: Tienes.   \\nT: Tienes. Good. So if I give you the version for he comes  it's viene . So how would you say you \\ncome ?  \\nS: Informal?T: Yes.  \\nS: Vienes.   \\nT: Vienes. The word for when  is cuándo . Cuándo .  \\nS: Cuándo .  \\nT: When are you coming? :  \\nS: Informal, vienes.   \\nT: It's the English that's confusing you.  \\nS: ¿Cuándo vienes?   \\nT: Exactly. So don 't let that English are you coming  confuse you. There's a lot we're doing in English \\nthere that we don't need to worry about for Spanish. ¿Cuándo vienes?  When are you coming to \\neat?:  \\nS: ¿Cuándo vienes a comer?   \\nT: A comer , very nice. ¿Cuándo viene s a comer? When are you coming to eat?  Tiene , what does \\ntiene  mean?  \\nS: Have .  \\nT: But I need you to be more specific. I'm giving you more information then just have . Tiene :  \\nS: He/it/she  or formal you.  \\nT: Very good. Ella tiene. Ella tiene:   \\nS: She has.   \\nT: Good. Quiero saber qué tiene.   \\nS: I want to know what you have .  \\nT: What you have,  or she, or it. Very good. We said that a very interesting detail about tener  is that \\nyou can also translate it as -tain, when this -tain forms part of another verb in  English. So contain  \\nbecomes contener . So how was it has or she has ? He has ?S: Tiene.   \\nT: Yes. We saw that it was tiene . We haven't looked at why yet, but we've seen that it's a little bit \\nirregular. In Spanish you can generalize this irregularity. How i s I have ?  \\nS: Tengo.   \\nT: Tengo. I obtain :  \\nS: Obtengo.   \\nT: Obtengo. Sounds rather formal in English, but in Spanish you might use it like get. I get it , lo \\nobtengo . I obtain it . To put in Spanish is poner . Poner .  \\nS: Poner .  \\nT: That means to put . And I put  you have the same business with this g popping up, so how do you \\nthink it sounds, I put?  \\nS: Pongo.   \\nT: Pongo. And poner  is interesting like tener , because when we have -pose inside of a verb in English \\nwe can turn that -pose into poner , and we get the ve rb in Spanish. So the example would be \\ncompose  becomes componer . So to compose  is componer . How would to suppose  be?  \\nS: Suposer.   \\nT: So compose  is componer . Suppose  is:  \\nS: Suponer.   \\nT: Suponer. And how do you think you would say I suppose ? We want to gen eralize our irregularities \\nin Spanish. So how was I put ? How was that? I put:  \\nS: Pongo.   \\nT: Pongo. So suponer , to suppose,  becomes, for I suppose :  \\nS: Supongo.T: Yeah. Supongo. And you will hear supongo que sí , I suppose that yes . I said that que can al so \\nmean that. I suppose so , we say in English. In Spanish you say I suppose that yes . Supongo que \\nsí. You will hear that. So we had componer , to compose ; suponer , to suppose . How would you \\nsay to impose ?  \\nS: Imponer.   \\nT: Imponer. To expose :  \\nS: Exponer.   \\nT: To oppose :  \\nS: Oponer.   \\nT: Yes. I oppose it.  I oppose it :  \\nS: Lo opongo.   \\nT: Lo opongo. I oppose it.  Good. And I have :  \\nS: Tengo.   \\nT: Tengo. And we said we can add on que to get the meaning of have to . So if you want to say I have \\nto see her , how  would you say I have to see her ?  \\nS: Tengo que verla.   \\nT: Good. We can say la tengo que ver or tengo que verla. Both are fine. How would you say I must \\nsee her , I owe to see her ?  \\nS: Debo verla.   \\nT: Debo verla. Or where else would you put that la?  \\nS: La debo ver.   \\nT: Good. La debo ver. The difference between tengo que and debo is exactly like English. We use \\nmust  when it's a bit more serious: I must see her . And we say have to  like an everyday kind of \\nthing. The way you use it in English and Spanish is exactly the same. So debo  is a little bit moresevere, a little bit more serious, and tener que , to have to with que, is more everyday. Tengo que \\ncomer ahora . What does that mean? Tengo que comer ahora :  \\nS: I have to eat now.   \\nT: Good. I have to eat now. What does it mean if I say voy a intentar comer más tarde ? Voy a  \\nintentar comer más tarde :  \\nS: Voy is I'm going .  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: Intentar ? Can you say the whole sentence again?  \\nT: Voy a intentar comer más tarde.   \\nS: It sounds odd, because it sounds like I'm going with the intention to eat later.  \\nT: Good, but it's not a noun. It's not the intention. It's not la intención , it's intentar . And when you \\nhear that -ar on the end, you can suspect that it's a verb. Most of the time it's going to be. So you \\nwant to something. Voy a intentar :  \\nS: I'm going to intend -  \\nT: I'm going to try.   \\nS: Ah.  \\nT: I'm going to try:  \\nS: To eat later.   \\nT: Exactly. I'm going to try to eat later. Good. So let's make a  very short recap on these useful verbs \\nthat tend to have verbs comin g after them in this way, like voy a . So we had voy a : I'm going to. I \\ncan?  It might help to know that the word power  is related to this word in Spanish. Of course when \\nyou can, when you're able to, you have the power  to. So it's related and it begins with  p. I can :  \\nS: Puedo.   \\nT: Puedo. Good. Voy a comer : I'm going to eat. Puedo comer  - what does that mean?S: I can eat.   \\nT: Yes. Tengo que comer :  \\nS: I have to eat.   \\nT: Debo comer :  \\nS: I must eat.   \\nT: Quiero comer :  \\nS: I want to eat.   \\nT: Good. So these ver bs: quiero , voy a, tengo  que, puedo , debo , they're very useful because we can \\njust put the “to ” form after.\",\n",
       " 'Track 15  \\nT: What was the word for what ?  \\nS: Qué.   \\nT: And do you remember how was to pass ?  \\nS: Pasar.   \\nT: Pasar. And this can also mean like to happen . To pass  in the sense of to occur . How do you say \\nhe passes ?  \\nS: Pasa.   \\nT: Good. And she passes :  \\nS: Pasa.   \\nT: And it passes :  \\nS: Pasa.   \\nT: Good. And if you want to say what passes , meaning what happens , what\\'s going on, what is \\nhappening ?:  \\nS: I remembered it now. I went through the whole process and I remember people saying ¿qué pasó ?  \\nT: This is the past. We said that when you emphasize that -o on the end it\\'s actually the version for \\nhe/she/it  in the past, so ¿qué pasó ? is what happened ?, and we will look at this later. But what is \\nwhat\\'s happening ? What is happening ?:  \\nS: ¿Qué pasa ?  \\nT: Good. So if you want to say I want to know what\\'s going on, I want to know what\\'s happening, I \\nwant to know what\\'s passing :  \\nS: Quiero saber qué pasa.   \\nT: Quiero saber qué pasa. I want to know what\\'s happening.  Good. There\\'s one more thing we need \\nto know about the present, and it\\'s gonna fill in, happily, a grey area for us which you might bewondering already: how did we get tiene  he/she/it/you (formal)  has or have , and then the other \\nversions tienen , tienes , from tener ? To want  is querer . What is I want ?  \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: Quiero. So how does querer  become quiero ? So there\\'s something else we need to know about \\nthe present to understand this, and then we c an manage the present completely. So what\\'s \\nhappening is that when we have an e in the “to” form of the verb like in tener : to have , like in \\nquerer : to want ; when we have an e inside of the verb it\\'s part of the root, not part of the ending. \\nNot that -er, that doesn\\'t count. But the /e/ in ten- and the /e/ in quer- of querer . When we stress \\nit, when we emphasize it, it often splits; most of the time, it splits into an ie under the stress of that \\naccent, under the stress when we say querer  we have the accent  on the end, we have the accent on \\nthe ending. Then when we take off that -er we put -o, we would have quero  but when we stress \\ndown that e it splits and it becomes quiero . The same for tener : we would have tene for he has , \\nbut when we stress down on t hat e it splits and it becomes tiene . The same for come . We have \\nvenir . But when we say he comes, she comes, it comes , you (formal) come , it would be vene , but \\nit becomes viene . Now it\\'s not happening with tengo , vengo , because we can say the n and the g \\nkind of hold it up. So this is probably why it got saved. But otherwise it splits. Now, this might \\nseem quite an abstract thing to get your head around, but what is very helpful is that we have these \\nbetween words in English and Spanish. We can identify the se between words in English and  \\nSpanish. For example, we have a word that we use for time in English, but only in music. Do you \\nknow what is this word? A word we use for time but only in music. When you speak about the \\ntime, the rhythm of music, you talk about its:  \\nS: Beat.  \\nT: Not beat but tempo . Now, time in Spanish is tiempo . You see the difference between tempo  and \\ntiempo , other than the Spanish pronunciation, is that the e has split into ie. So you can even see it \\nbetween words in English and Sp anish. Concert  in Spanish is - try and do the same thing.  \\nS: Concierto.   \\nT: Concierto. Good. You stuck in an o to make it sound more Spanish and you split that e. Concierto . \\nNovember  is Noviembre . So this will help us remember. So this happens most of the  time. We \\nalready saw places that it doesn\\'t happen; we saw very briefly the verb llegar , which was to arriveand we said llego , I arrive . We saw esperar , which was to wait or to hope , espero . It\\'s not \\nhappening. But most of the time it\\'s going to happen. We saw it happening with tener  which \\nbecame tiene , he/she/it/you (formal), tienen , they or you (plural), tienes,  you (informal).  \\nWe saw it happening with venir , to come : viene , vienes , vienen . Another verb that we see this \\nway is pensar . what do you thi nk pensar  means?  \\nS: Thoughtful .  \\nT: But it is a verb. There is no verb to thoughtful , is there?  \\nS: Well, to think .  \\nT: Yes that\\'s it,  to think . It\\'s very useful for us to group words into families. So “verb” is a family. So \\nwhen you decide what type of w ord it is, then you narrow down the possible behaviors of that \\nword, and you manage to manage it much easier. And making that very clearly - that connection - \\nis really really helpful for you. To think , pensar . So if you say I think , how is it going to be?   \\nS: Pienso.   \\nT: Good. It would be penso  but you stress down on that e and it splits into ie and you get pienso .  \\nHow is he thinks or she thinks or it thinks or you (formal)?  \\nS: Piense.   \\nT: This sounds like vowel harmony. I mean it sounds nice, piense , because we have ie and then we \\nwant to put an e next to it because it matches. But that\\'s Turkish grammar. You must know where \\nyou are with any verb. And to know where you are you must go back to the “to\" form. Then you \\nare confident.  \\nS: So it\\'s piensar .  \\nT: Pensar.   \\nS: Pensar , not penser .  \\nT: No, pensar . So you must go back there and then you feel confident. Otherwise the base is going \\nto effect what vowel you want to put on.S: Piensa.   \\nT: Piensa. You (informal):  \\nS: Piensas.   \\nT: Good. What do you think? :  \\nS: ¿Qué piensas ?  \\nT: Yeah. ¿Qué piensas ? This is a useful verb as well actually. Because if you say I think to eat  it \\nmeans I plan on eating . You can say I think to eat , that simple. I think to eat : how would it sound?  \\nS: Pienso comer.   \\nT: Pienso co mer. I think to eat  later is I plan on eating later . So how would you say I plan on eating \\nlater ?  \\nS: Pienso comer tarde.   \\nT: That means I plan on eating late , which is fine, but later  is more late . And more  is related to \\nmassive .  \\nS: Más tarde.   \\nT: Good. Pienso comer más tarde. I plan on eating later. So you can use it like that as well. We saw \\nvenir  also splits with the exception of vengo . He comes, she comes, you (formal) - how would that \\nbe?  \\nS: Viene.   \\nT: Viene. They :  \\nS: Vienen.   \\nT: Vienen. You (informal):  \\nS: Vienes.   \\nT: Good. Do you remember how was when ?  \\nS: Cúando .T: Cúando . When are you coming ?:  \\nS: ¿Cuándo vienes ?  \\nT: ¿Cuándo vienes ? Entender  means to understand . You can use comprender  if you forget it, but \\nentender  is bet ter. It\\'s more common. But comprender  is easier because it sounds like \\ncomprehend , and also in comprender  the e doesn\\'t split. I understand is comprendo . But with \\nentender  it does split. So you can use comprender,  but most common in Spanish is entender  for \\nunderstand. And here the e does split. So how would you say I understand ?  \\nS: Entiendo.   \\nT: Entiendo. How would you say he understands ?  \\nS: Entiende.   \\nT: Entiende. Good. They :  \\nS: Entienden.   \\nT: Entienden. Perder  means to lose . It\\'s kind of related to perish, there is a connection there, or \\nperishable food. You know, food that rots, or real food. Perder , to lose. I lose :  \\nS: Pierdo.   \\nT: Pierdo. Good. The process is perder -perdo , maybe it splits: pierdo . Good. I lose it :  \\nS: Lo pierdo.   \\nT: Lo pierdo. Good. I lose them :  \\nS: Los pierdo.   \\nT: Los pierdo. Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 16  \\nT: Comenzar , what do you think that means? Comenzar :  \\nS: To commence.   \\nT: To commence. Or?  \\nS: To start.   \\nT: To start.  Again this exists and you can use it and it’s probably easier becau se it sounds like \\ncommence so it’s easier to remember. But there’s another verb which is more common, which is \\nempezar . Empezar  This is a z so that’s going to sound / th/ in Spain, empe /th/ar in most of Spain.  \\nEmpezar .  \\nS: Empezar.   \\nT: Practice with this one for now. This is to start . How do you say I start ?  \\nS: Empezo.   \\nT: Good that\\'s what it should be, but what might happen?  \\nS: Empiezo.   \\nT: Empiezo. He starts:   \\nS: Empieze.   \\nT: What must you do before you make that decision? What must you do? You must go  back to the \\n“to\" form. It\\'s a very important habit.  \\nS: It’s empezar . Empeza.   \\nT: Good. And then what might be the next step after empeza ?  \\nS: Empieza.   \\nT: Empieza. So this is the process we want to take. It\\'s essential for us to get into that habit of go ing \\nback to the “to\" form and then we know where we are. Otherwise it\\'s guesswork. Empieza: \\nempezar -empieza. They start :S: Empiezan.   \\nT: Empiezan. Good. You (informal ):  \\nS: Empiezas.   \\nT: Good. When are you starting? :  \\nS: ¿Cuándo empiezas?   \\nT: ¿Cuándo emp iezas? Very good. So the e can split to ie; that\\'s something we need to know about \\nthe present and it\\'s something we need to be on top of. Now it\\'s in the present that this happens \\nbecause, as we know, one of the fundamental elements of the present tense i s to have that accent \\non the penultimate syllable. So it\\'s having that accent on the penultimate syllable that makes that \\ne vulnerable to splitting. The e might split to ie, or the o might split to ue. We know this already \\nactually because we have puedo , and this is a split o. To be able , or “to can”, of course there is no \\n“to can\" in English, to be able we say is poder . Here actually you can see closer that connection \\nwith power . Before, I said that the word is related to the word power  in English.  El poder - el is \\nthe masculine the - we also saw it\\'s the word for he, it\\'s also the word for the for masculine words. \\nEl poder is the power . So here it\\'s a noun. It looks like a verb, but if it has the in front of it, we \\nknow it\\'s a noun. El poder  - the power . Poder  - to be able . When you take off your ending and \\nyou change it for present tense, and you stress that o, it splits into ue, and you get puedo . Again \\nwe can see the same phenomenon happening between words in English and Spanish. So, for \\nexample,  we have the word port in English, but we say Puerto Rico . Puerto Rico means “the rich \\nport\". Rico  means rich or nice or tasty  or sweet . So port becomes puerto . We see the o is splitting \\ninto ue. We have the word force  in English, in Spanish this is fuerza . We have the word school,  \\nin Spanish this is escuela . We have corp in like corporate , which means body . If Corp  means body  \\nin corporate , how do you think it is in Spanish?  \\nS: Cuerpo.   \\nT: Cuerpo. Good. We have innovative , and this nov in innovative  means new. When you do \\nsomething innovative, you do something new. And the word for new in Spanish is nuevo . So you \\nsaw the o splitting there. You might have heard pueblo  before. Pueblo  means a village  or a people . \\nPopulation  in Spanish is one of these exc eptions. It\\'s not populación , it\\'s población . And you cansee the connection between población  and pueblo , which means village  or people . A people . You \\ncan see the o in pob- splitting into ue in pueblo . Mortgage , by the way, actually means “death  \\npact\". You have mort -, which is the Latin root for death , and -gage , which means pact. The word \\nfor dead  in Spanish is - have a guess.  \\nS: Muerto  or muerte .  \\nT: Well actually, here, one you have the noun, la muerte is the death . So the noun is the w ord you \\nput the in front of. In school they tell you that it\\'s the thing, the object. But this is not an object. \\nWe would think of it, we put the in front of it, it\\'s a noun. La muerte . But then the adjective, which \\nis describing, it\\'s muerto  or muerta . Or muertos  or muertas . So you can see in those words \\nbetween English and Spanish this phenomenon of this o splitting into ue when it takes the stress. \\nSo this is useful for us for present tense. We need to know this for present tense because if we have \\na ver b like dormir , for example, that has an o in the root, when we stress it, it might split. What \\ndo you think dormir  means?  \\nS: Staying still  or dormant ?  \\nT: Yeah, what does dormant  mean? A dormant volcano. It actually means it\\'s a sleeping volcano. Or \\ndormi tory, this is a nice connection to make as well. So dormir  means to sleep . How do you say \\nI sleep ?  \\nS: Duermo.   \\nT: Duermo. Good. In Spanish if you want to say I fall asleep , you can say I sleep myself . So how \\nwould that sound?  \\nS: Me duermo.   \\nT: Me duermo.  Which means I fall asleep , rather than duermo , I sleep . So you can say I\\'m falling \\nasleep , me duermo . It\\'s so boring, me duermo . He sleeps :  \\nS: Duerme.   \\nT: Duerme. Good. They sleep :  \\nS: Duermen.T: Duermen. What do you think encontrar  means? Encontrar :  \\nS: To encounter.   \\nT: Good. Which probably means:  \\nS: To meet.   \\nT: Oh it does, it means that as well, but there\\'s a more usual meaning as well.  \\nS: To find ?  \\nT: Yes. So I\\'m finding it or I find it , how would you say that?  \\nS: Lo, is it encuentro ?  \\nT: Yes it  is.  \\nS: Lo encuentro.   \\nT: Good. Something useful to bear in mind is that different versions of the verb, either the “to\" form \\nor some other version, might be the noun. So you mustn’t assume always that it\\'s a verb. If you \\nsee un encuentro  - an encounter  - this is now a noun. An encounter . Whatever we can put a or the \\nin front of is a noun. So , many times some version of the verb will be the noun. Un encuentro is \\nan encounter but encuentro , I encounter .  \\nDemostrar  was to demonstrate , and if we get rid of th is de-, we get mostrar  which means to show .  \\nMostrar . So how would you say: I show ?  \\nS: Mostro .  \\nT: It would be mostro -  \\nS: Muestro ?  \\nT: Muestro. Good. He shows :  \\nS: Muestre , wait. Mostrar . Muestra .T: Good. Muestra. We don\\'t need to roll the r here becau se it\\'s just one r. Muestra . Good. And una \\nmuestra actually is a sample. So there is a noun there that shares that version. Muestra : he shows, \\nit shows, she shows, you (formal) show . But una muestra is a sample . They show :  \\nS: Muestran.   \\nT: Muestran. Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 17  \\nT: So we\\'ve seen how two sounds in the verbs in the present tense might split when we put pressure \\non them. We’ve seen how e might become ie, so for example we have querer  which means to \\nwant , but I want is:  \\nS: Quiero.   \\nT: Quiero.  So we stress down on that e and it splits into ie. And this will happen for the other versions \\nthat we learned as well. So how do you say he wants or she wants or you (formal) want ?  \\nS: Quiere.   \\nT: Quiere. They want :  \\nS: Quieren.   \\nT: Quieren. Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: Quieres.   \\nT: Good. What do you want? :  \\nS: ¿Qué quieres?   \\nT: Yeah. ¿Qué quieres? Good. So another example where this will happen is with the verb perder , \\nwhich means to lose . It\\'s related to perish . So how would you say: I lose ?  \\nS: Pierdo.  \\nT: Pierdo. And he loses , she loses :  \\nS: Pierde.   \\nT: Pierde. They :  \\nS: Pierden.   \\nT: Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: Pierdes.T: Pierdes. Good. So we saw that the e can split into ie, and we also saw that an o in the base of the \\nverb can split into ue. So we saw, for example, poder  is to be able . And then we have puedo , I \\ncan, I am able . We had dormir , what did dormir  mean?  \\nS: To sleep.   \\nT: Good. And duermo :  \\nS: I sleep.   \\nT: Good. What changed when we added me? Me duermo :  \\nS: I think it\\'s I fall asl eep.  \\nT: Yes. I sleep myself , I fall asleep . Good. So we can expect to see these o\\'s split, but not always.  \\nFor example, to eat  was? To eat :  \\nS: Comer.   \\nT: Comer. And I eat:  \\nS: Como.   \\nT: Como. So it didn\\'t split there. So there\\'s no way to know where it will, where it won\\'t. Most of the \\ntime it will and you just have to kind of experiment and see what happens. And you will always \\nget the feedback when you try to see if it splits or not. You\\'ll also develop an intuition of where \\nyou should do it. So colgar , for example, is to hang . So if you want to say I hang :  \\nS: Cuelgo.   \\nT: Cuelgo. Good. He hangs :  \\nS: Cuelge , no it\\'s colgar , so it\\'s cuelga .  \\nT: Cuelga.  Why do you think you said cuelge  first?  \\nS: Well the reason you explained before with the - becau se it has an /e/ sound before, it seems to go \\nmore.T: Exactly, it fits more. So you will find yourself doing that. How do you get out of doing that, how \\ndo you stop that happening?  \\nS: By going back to the “to” version of the verb.  \\nT: Exactly, and then you\\'re in control. Colgar , -ar verb, cuelga . Good. They hang : \\nS: Cuelgan.   \\nT: Good. They hang it :  \\nS: Lo cuelgan.   \\nT: Lo cuelgan. They hang them :  \\nS: Los cuelgan.   \\nT: Good. She hangs them :  \\nS: Los cuelga.   \\nT: Good. Los cuelga.  Words in English that begin al-, so not end -al like normal , normal , metal , \\nmetal , they begin al-, they come from Arabic. This al- means the in Arabic. And in Arabic it\\'s \\nwritten with the word. It\\'s written as one word. It\\'s all stuck together. So when words came in from \\nArabic they k ind of came in most of the time with this al-, which meant the. So for example, \\nalcohol , and when we say the alcohol , we are actually saying something like “the the alcohol”, \\nsomething like this. The verb to take is tomar . Tomar.  T-o-m-a-r.  \\nS: Tomar.   \\nT: Tomar. And this is also used like to drink . So it\\'s used like take generically, generally, but also to \\ndrink . How would you say: I don\\'t drink alcohol, I don\\'t take alcohol ?  \\nS: No tomo alcohol.   \\nT: Good. No tomo alcohol. Sugar  in Spanish is azucar .  \\nS: Azucar.   \\nT: Azucar. Or in Spain because we have a z here, it will be / athucar / in most of Spain. Now, this is \\nalso an Arabic word, and it\\'s the same word as sugar  in English. Might not look like it. What\\'shappened here? In Arabic, the l of al - the word f or the - assimilates, changes to match the next \\nletter if the next letter is kind of close to it. It does this with about half the letters. So in Arabic \\nactually, instead of alzucar , you say azucar . And this passed into Spanish. But in English we got \\nthe w ord without the the at the beginning this time. This time sugar  came in without the the at the \\nbeginning. So they look kind of different, and sound rather different : sugar , azucar . But again \\nthey\\'re the same word. So how would you say: I don\\'t take s ugar ?  \\nS: No tomo azucar.   \\nT: Good. No tomo azucar. Arroz , rice, is also an Arabic word. It\\'s actually al ruz , the rice . But again \\nin Spanish, the l assimilated to the next r, as it does in Arabic and instead of al ruz like in arabic, \\narruz , we ended up wi th arroz .  \\nS: So it\\'s two r\\'s?  \\nT: Two r\\'s.  \\nS: So is azucar  with two s\\'s?  \\nT: Nope. It\\'s with a z here because two s\\'s are not a combination you find in Spanish. So for example, \\nin the word possible , we have two s\\'s there in English. But in Spanish when w e write posible , we \\nwrite one s. The same with passion ; we write one s in Spanish, pasión . So you don\\'t get two s\\'s \\ntogether in Spanish. But you do get two r\\'s together to differentiate between the normal r and the \\nrolling r. So in Spanish we have a-r-r-o-z. It\\'s just assimilation of al ruz: arruz , to Spanish arroz . \\nAnd it\\'s the same word that\\'s in English, rice. So how do you say: I want rice ?  \\nS: Quiero arroz.   \\nT: Quiero arroz. Good. Algebra . How would that be in Spanish?  \\nS: Alguebra ? \\nT: /Al-juh-\\nbra/ S: \\nAlgebra.   \\nT: Algebra. Good. Spanish has a lot more Arabic than English. The south of Spain was part of the \\nMuslim world for 800 years, so the languages had a lot of contact. And you get more words inSpanish that you don\\'t have in English that are from Ar abic. So for example, aceite , oil. In Arabic \\nthis is zet. Aceite . Aceituna , olive , zetun  in Arabic. Alfombra , which means carpet , almohada , \\nwhich means pillow , all of these words they came in from Arabic. When you find al- at the \\nbeginning, with maybe a co uple of exceptions, it\\'s from Arabic. So we said I take is tomo .  \\nHow is: he takes, she takes, it takes, you (formal) take?  \\nS: Toma.   \\nT: Toma. Good. You (informal)? Talking to a friend:  \\nS: Tomas.   \\nT: Good. How would you say what are you taking? This cou ld be a way to ask what do you want to \\ndrink ?  \\nS: ¿Qué tomas ?  \\nT: ¿Qué tomas ? To drink  exists. It\\'s beber , beber . And the word drink , the noun: una bebida , a \\ndrink . Una,  we have a for feminine words - una bebida or la bebida , the drink , comes from beber. \\nBut tomar , to take , is extremely common. They take :  \\nS: Toman.   \\nT: Toman. Good. Now there\\'s one more version of the verbs that we didn\\'t learn yet, which was the \\n“we” version. We didn\\'t learn how to say we want  or we have . Now we take is tomamos . Expl ain \\nto me what I did then to get we take . If I go from tomar  to tomamos  what am I doing?  \\nS: You took out the -r and put a -mos at the end.  \\nT: But to make it fit in with your -  \\nS: Well you took out the -ar, the -ar sound, and you put in the -amos  sound.  \\nT: Good. This is very nice to think about it this way because then you fit it in with what you\\'ve been \\ndoing up until now. Taking off the -ar, a-r, and putting in your ending. So you take off -ar and \\nyou put on -amos  and you get the “we” form. So, how is: to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar.T: Hablar. And we speak :  \\nS: Hablamos.   \\nT: Hablamos. Good. So with -amos  we\\'re adding on two syllables, and the accent is going on the \\nsecond last syllable. So it\\'s in a different position, that accent, to the other versions. If we l ook at \\ntomo, toma, toman, tomas, tomamos , the accent is moving. Again, to speak :  \\nS: Hablar.   \\nT: I speak :  \\nS: Hablo.   \\nT: She speaks :  \\nS: Habla.   \\nT: Habla. They speak :  \\nS: Hablan.   \\nT: You (informal):  \\nS: Hablas.   \\nT: We:  \\nS: Hablamos.   \\nT: Hablamos.  Good. So this affects the split of the e or the o in the root of the verb. Because we said \\nthat it splits because you stress it. But in the “we” form we don\\'t actually stress it. So let\\'s look at \\nthis. What was to find or to encounter ?  \\nS: Encontrar.   \\nT: Encontrar.  I find :  \\nS: Encuentro.   \\nT: Encuentro. I find or I’m finding. He finds :  \\nS: Encuentra.T: Encuentra. Good. You went back to the “to\" form, right?  \\nS: Yep.  \\nT: They :  \\nS: Encuentran.   \\nT: Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: Encuentras.   \\nT: Good. Now we. You\\'re not  stressing that o anymore so it\\'s safe. It\\'s not going to split.  \\nS: Encontramos.   \\nT: Very good. Encontramos. We don\\'t stress it , so it doesn\\'t split. What was demonstration ?  \\nS: Demonstración. Demostración.   \\nT: Demostración. So how would you say: to demon strate ?  \\nS: Demostrar.   \\nT: Demostrar. If you take away this de-, which actually means of in Spanish. If you get rid of it \\nyou\\'re left with mostrar  and what does mostrar  mean?  \\nS: To show.   \\nT: To show. I show or I\\'m showing :  \\nS: Mostro.   \\nT: It should be mostro, but-  \\nS: Muestro.   \\nT: Good. Muestro. And he, or she/it/you  (formal):  \\nS: Muestra.   \\nT: Good. They  or you guys :  \\nS: Muestran.T: Muestran. You (informal):  \\nS: Muestras.   \\nT: We:  \\nS: Mostramos.   \\nT: Very good. Mostramos. You\\'re not accenting anymore that o, so it doesn\\'t split. Mostramos.  \\nHow do you say to think ? And we said it\\'s related to the word pensive .  \\nS: Pensar.   \\nT: Pensar. Good. I think :  \\nS: Pienso.   \\nT: Pienso. There the e splits when we stress it. If you want to say I think so , you can just say I think \\nthat yes . I think that yes . That is the same as what?  \\nS: Que. Pienso que sí.  \\nT: Pienso que sí. I think so , pienso que sí. Good. He thinks or she thinks , you (formal) think :  \\nS: Piensa.   \\nT: Good. Piensa. They :  \\nS: Piensan.   \\nT: You (informal) :  \\nS: Piensas.   \\nT: What do you think?:   \\nS: ¿Qué piensas?   \\nT: Good. If you say what do you think to do , we said that this means what do you plan on doing . You \\ncan just say what do you think to do . What was to do ? To do or to make which begins with a silent \\nh:S: Hacer.   \\nT: Hacer. Good. So what do you think to do, what do you plan on doing? :  \\nS: Qué- You informal? Qué piensas hacer.   \\nT: Good. Qué piensas hacer. Now how would you say: we think ?  \\nS: Pensamos.   \\nT: Good. Pensamos. So you’re not splitting ther e. Pensamos. The verb to close, to close, is cerrar . \\nc-e-r-r-a-r. Cerrar .  \\nS: Cerrar.   \\nT: Good. Or in most of Spain, / therrar /. How would you say: I close ?  \\nS: Cierro.   \\nT: Cierro. Good. She closes, he closes, you  (formal) close :  \\nS: Cierra.   \\nT: Cierra. Good. So how would you say: we close ?  \\nS: Cerramos.   \\nT: Good. So we\\'re seeing that really this issue of the e\\'s and the o\\'s splitting is an issue about stress, \\nand it’s only when we stress them down that they split under that pressure. When we don’t, they \\nare intact .',\n",
       " 'Track 18  \\nT: So for -ar verbs, we have -amos  in the present for we. Now for -er verbs, we have -emos  for the \\nwe, and for -ir verbs we have -imos . This is the only time in the whole language that we find a \\ndifference betw een -er and -ir verbs. They\\'re one group, but here - and it\\'s the only time in the \\nentire language - we have a difference between the two of them; in the present for we. For -ir verbs \\nwe have -imos  and for -er verbs we have -emos . So preferir . What do you think that means, \\npreferir ?  \\nS: Prefer.   \\nT: Good. To prefer.  To prefer.  We want to think with the “to\" whenever the verb ends in an r it\\'s \\ngoing to help us just to think of that as “to”. To prefer . Preferir.  So how would you say: I prefer ?  \\nS: Prefer o.  \\nT: Good. It should be prefero.   \\nS: Prefiero.   \\nT: Prefiero. It splits. Prefiero. He prefers :  \\nS: Prefiere.   \\nT: Prefiere. They  or you (plural):  \\nS: Prefieren.   \\nT: Good. How would you say we prefer  (and preferir  has an -ir ending )?  \\nS: Preferimos.   \\nT: Preferimos. So there the -er doesn\\'t split, and also the i of -ir is appearing in the endings for the \\nfirst time in the present tense. Preferimos . Good.  \\nWhat was to come ? It had something to do with convenient , when things “with -come\".  \\nS: Venir.   \\nT: Venir. And how would you say: we come  or we\\'re coming ?S: Venimos.   \\nT: Venimos. Good. To live  in Spanish is vivir . V-i-v-i-r.  \\nS: Vivir.   \\nT: You might know this from viva la revolución , you might have heard that somewhere. Long live \\nthe revolution : viva la revolución . Or you might have even heard viva Las Vegas : long live Las \\nVegas . Vivir : to live . How do you say: I live ?  \\nS: Vivo.   \\nT: Vivo. Here  in Spanish is aquí  or acá. Aquí  in Spain, and acá in Latin America. Everybody \\nunderstands both. It\\'s an extrem ely common word so you don\\'t have to worry aquí  or acá. So I \\nlive here :  \\nS: Vivo aquí .  \\nT: Vivo aquí, Vivo acá.  Good. I don\\'t live here :  \\nS: No vivo aquí.   \\nT: Good. But he lives here . And let\\'s stress that because we\\'re contrasting. But HE lives here:   \\nS: Pero él ?  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: Vive aquí.   \\nT: Good. Let\\'s make it all together. I don\\'t live here , but he lives here:   \\nS: No vivo aquí, pero él vive aquí.   \\nT: Good. And don\\'t be afraid to try the soft b. If it\\'s too difficult then it\\'s not a problem that you \\npronounce the / vuh/. Maybe you want to pronounce the / vuh/ at the beginning and then see what \\nhappens. But the more you pronounce like how people are speaking around you, the more you \\nunderstand. To know is:  \\nS: Saver.T: Saber. This is a b.  \\nS: It\\'s a b, saber.  \\nT: Saber.  This is a b so you\\'re not going to pronounce a v. Saber. So we have vivir , to live . And we \\nneed to open up the association of the letter v to include that soft b. Maybe you look up the word \\nin the dictionary for summer which is verano  or /berano /. Now if you just program your mind \\nwith verano  maybe you won\\'t get it when you hear / berano /. So it always makes sense to \\npronounce the words the way people around you are pronouncing. So if you are practicing Spanish \\nwith Colombians, take their acc ent. If you are practicing with people from Rio de la Plata, Buenos \\nAries, Montevideo, who have kind of a particular accent, take that accent as well. If you\\'re \\npracticing with people from Madrid, take their accent. The more you speak lik e the people you\\'re \\nlistening to, the easier you understand. Vivir , to live . How is: we live ?  \\nS: Vivimos.   \\nT: Vivimos. There we have the i popping up: vivimos . But for the other versions, we’re going to have \\nthe /e/. So he lives :  \\nS: Veve.   \\nT: Some vowel harmony you\\'re making there, Vivir ? The / e/ is correct but you changed the beginning \\nto match that / e/.  \\nS: Vive.   \\nT: Good. Vive. Before you said veve.  This is vowel harmony again. So you must consciously take off \\nthat ending, see what you\\'re left with, vivir  - viv, and put on your ending: vive - e. Good.  \\nThey live , or you guys :  \\nS: Viven.   \\nT: Viven. They live here :  \\nS: Viven aquí .  \\nT: Viven aquí, viven acá. The word for where  is dónde, dónde.  So how would you say: ¿where do \\nthey live ?:S: ¿Dónde viven ?  \\nT: I want to know where they live :  \\nS: Quiero saber dónde viven.   \\nT: Good. Quiero saber dónde viven. Good. Entender  is to understand . Entender . We said we can \\nuse comprender  as well, which might be easy to remember, but entender  is mu ch more common. \\nHow do you say: I understand ?  \\nS: Entiendo.   \\nT: Entiendo. Good. The e splits : entender -entiendo . He understands :  \\nS: Entiende.   \\nT: Entiende. He doesn\\'t understand :  \\nS: No entiende.   \\nT: Why doesn\\'t he understand?   \\nS: ¿Por qué no entiende?   \\nT: ¿Por qué no entiende? Good. I want to know why he doesn\\'t understand :  \\nS: Quiero saber por qué no entiende.   \\nT: Quiero saber por qué no entiende. How do you think you would say: we understand ?  \\nS: Entendemos.   \\nT: Good. So for -er verbs we have -emos . So this is the only difference in the entire language between \\n-er verbs and -ir verbs. For everything else they are exactly the same. But for we in the present \\ntense, we get -imos  and -emos . Vivir -vivimos , venir -venimos , preferir -preferimos , and then for \\n-er verbs -emos . Entender -entendemos . Perder , which we said was to lose . So how do you say: \\nwe lose ?  \\nS: Perdemos.T: Perdemos. Good. The word for always  in Spanish is siempre.  So how would you say: we always \\nlose? (You can put the siempre  before or afterwa rds.)  \\nS: Siempre perdemos.   \\nT: Siempre perdemos. We always lose . Or perdemos siempre .',\n",
       " 'Track 19  \\nT: We said that the word for always  was siempre .  \\nS: Siempre.   \\nT: Good. Now if you know Italian or some other Latin language, maybe you have some thing like \\nsempre  in that language, and you can see again that the e is splitting between sempre  and siempre . \\nSo if you know one of these other languages, or have studied them, it can be useful just to notice \\nthat. And just noticing that helps you internalize this new word. So for example, well in Spanish \\nis bien like in the beginning of welcome , bienvenido . This in Italian is bene . We see that we get \\nrid of the e, the last e, and the e in the middle splits. You have from French bon for good . What \\ndo you  think good  might be in Spanish? What do you think you will do to make that more Spanish?  \\nS: Bueno.   \\nT: Bueno. We also said that vamos  meant we are going or let\\'s go , and it\\'s something you\\'re gonna \\nhear all the time. Vamos , vamos , let\\'s go .  \\nNow, another  useful skill that we want in language learning is to work backwards, not just to work \\nfrom the “to” form, take off the -ar or the -er or -ir and add bits on. But we want to get in the habit \\nof also working backwards, because maybe we see or hear some where a word like vamos , and we \\nwant to be able to work backwards from vamos  to get the other versions. Taking off the ending \\nwhich is for we, and put ting our other bits on. So could you work out from vamos  how it would \\nbe he goes or is going, she goes or is going , you (formal) go or are going ?  \\nS: The thing is you don\\'t know the ending of the “to\" form.  \\nT: If you have -amos , you know which is your vowel, no?  \\nS: /a/.  \\nT: /a/. So, work backwards.  \\nS: Ah, yes, okay, so va?  \\nT: Va. What does that me an? Va:S: He/she/it  or you (formal) are going .  \\nT: Good. Va. How would you make that you (informal )?  \\nS: Vas.  \\nT: Vas. Good. If you want to say where are you going , you will hear to where are you going?  What \\nwas the word for to?  \\nS: A.  \\nT: A. So how woul d you say To where are you going? :  \\nS: ¿A dónde vas ?  \\nT: ¿A dónde vas ? What would be they go ? Or you (plural) go:  \\nS: Van.   \\nT: Van. Van. Good. So we can work backwards. Vamos -va-vas-van. What was the I version? It was \\nirregular and we remembered it by thinking  I\\'m going on a voyage:   \\nS: Voy.   \\nT: Now the “to” form to go  is ir. I-r all by itself: ir. This is to go . So it\\'s very irregular. And this is \\nactually because this verb is two verbs that kind of stuck together to form one verb over time. So \\nin Fre nch you have like aller , which means going , and in English we get alleyway  from this. An \\nalleyway  is like a road, no? And this is related to ir. So ir comes from one verb, historically. And \\nthen the versions of ir actually come from a different verb. So they kind of stuck together over \\ntime and they give us this very irregular situation. That\\'s just for interest, we don\\'t need to know \\nany of this. All we need to know is voy from voyage  and vamos  and we can work backwards from \\nvamos  and there we have th e complete set. Voy, vamos, va, vas, van . But to go i s ir. they are \\ncoming from two different verbs historically, which is why we have ir, which is an -ir verb, but a \\ncoming up for all of the different versions. So how would you say I want to go ?  \\nS: Quiero ir.   \\nT: Good. I can go . I have the power to go :  \\nS: Puedo ir.T: Good. I must go :  \\nS: Debo ir.   \\nT: Debo ir. I have to go.  So not I must go , debo ir ; I have to go . What is I have  from tener ?  \\nS: Tengo.   \\nT: Tengo. And what do we add to that to get the meaning of have to ?  \\nS: A?  \\nT: Que. Like I said there\\'s no comfortable translation for it, but we add on que to tengo  and we get \\nthe feeling of “have to\" rather than the feeling of possession. So I have to go :  \\nS: Tengo que ir.   \\nT: Tengo que ir. I have  to go now :  \\nS: Tengo que ir ahora.   \\nT: Good. The word for tonight  is this night : esta noche . Esta noche. So I have to go tonight, I have \\nto go this night :  \\nS: Tengo que ir esta noche.   \\nT: Now noche  is feminine. We know this because esta, the word for this, is ending in an a. So how \\nwould you say: the night ?  \\nS: La noche.   \\nT: La noche. So we said that words ending a are feminine, or there are feminine endings like -ión or \\n-idad. La opinión, la oportunidad. If it ends in an e, there\\'s actually no way o f knowing whether \\nit\\'s masculine or feminine by the word. You have to look up what\\'s around it, or in the dictionary \\nit will tell you. But if you hear it in conversation, you have a look at what\\'s around it, esta noche , \\nand then you can go oh okay, so  noch e is feminine. Another example of a feminine word that ends \\nin an e is carne , carne . What do you think carne  means? It\\'s not at all obvious. You have carnage  \\nin English. It was just carnage . Carne  is meat . Meat.  And it\\'s a feminine word. So the meat :  \\nS: La carne.T: La carne. I don\\'t eat meat :  \\nS: No como carne.   \\nT: No como carne. The word for and in Spanish is y. And it\\'s just spelt with a y by itself. Y.  \\nS: Y.  \\nT: I don\\'t eat meat and I don\\'t drink , or I don\\'t take, alcohol . So tomar  was to take , tomar . And \\ncomer , to eat . So how would you say I don\\'t eat meat, and I don\\'t take alcohol ? I don\\'t drink \\nalcohol .  \\nS: No como carne.   \\nT: And:  \\nS: Y.  \\nT: I don’t drink alcohol :  \\nS: No tomo alcohol - alcohol .  \\nT: Alcohol.  Good. Because we don\\'t pronounce h in Spanish, do we? No como carne y no tomo \\nalcohol. Or If you wanted to say I eat meat , and I take alcohol ; I eat meat, and I drink alcohol,  \\nhow would that be?  \\nS: Como carne y tomo alcohol.   \\nT: Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 20  \\nT: We mentioned that with future co ntext we can talk about the future using the present. For example, \\nwe had tomorrow  which was:  \\nS: Mañana.   \\nT: Mañana. Good. We had later , or more late , which was:  \\nS: Más tarde.   \\nT: Más tarde. We had tonight , or this night :  \\nS: Esta noche.   \\nT: Esta noche. Good. Another one is pronto . What do you think pronto  means?  \\nS: Now.   \\nT: Ahora  was now, no?  \\nS: Soon ?  \\nT: Soon . Yeah. You hear in English sometimes get here pronto . It\\'s get here soon . So pronto  is also \\nfuture context. What was the verb to see , or to view ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: He sees :  \\nS: Ve.  \\nT: Good. They :  \\nS: Ven.   \\nT: You (informal):  \\nS: Ves.  \\nT: We:  \\nS: Vemos.T: Very good. The I version is a tiny bit irregular, it\\'s veo. So you have v-e-o. So it\\'s not vo as it \\nshould be, or / bo/. It was too short; it became  veo.  \\nS: Veo.   \\nT: V-e-o. /beo/ or / veo/. How how would you say: I’m seeing her later ?  \\nS: Veo ella más tarde.   \\nT: That means I see she later .  \\nS: It\\'s not la?  \\nT: It is.  \\nS: Oh so it\\'s la veo .  \\nT: La veo. Good.  \\nS: La veo más tarde.   \\nT: La veo más ta rde. I\\'m seeing her tonight :  \\nS: La veo esta noche.   \\nT: Good. La veo esta noche. We are seeing her soon .  We are seeing her soon :  \\nS: La venemos pronto.   \\nT: What is: to see ?  \\nS: Sorry it should be vemos ?  \\nT: Yes. So no guessing. No guessing at all. It\\'s th e only rule.  \\nS: La vemos pronto.   \\nT: Good. La vemos pronto. What if we say we\\'re seeing, we will see, them soon  but with this them  \\nwe mean a female group? We\\'re seeing them soon :  \\nS: Las vemos pronto.T: Good. Las vemos pronto. He is seeing them soon.  And this them,  they are still females. He is \\nseeing them soon:   \\nS: Las ve pronto.   \\nT: Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: La ves pronto.   \\nT: Them  soon. You\\'re seeing them :  \\nS: Las ves pronto.   \\nT: Good. I\\'ll make it a question: are you seeing them soon?  The female them .  \\nS: ¿Las ves pronto?   \\nT: ¿Las ves pronto? Aren\\'t you seeing them soon? :  \\nS: ¿No las ves pronto?   \\nT: ¿No las ves pronto? Why aren\\'t you seeing them soon? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no las ves pronto?   \\nT: Good. ¿Por qué no las ves pronto? Very good. So we saw that  with future context, we don\\'t need \\nthe future. If we don\\'t have future context, we can still use the present to talk about the future using \\nthis I go or I\\'m going , which is present, but we can use it to talk about the future in Spanish as we \\ndo in English . I\\'m going to see her , and you\\'re talking about the future. We\\'re going to see her . So \\nlet\\'s practice that - how would you say: we\\'re going to see her ?  \\nS: Vamos a verla.   \\nT: Are you going to see him soon?  Speaking informally. Are you going to see him soo n? So you can\\'t \\nwork with ir, which is to go . You should probably work with vamos  and work backwards.  \\nS: Vas. ¿Vas a verlo pronto ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Vas a verlo pronto ? The word for us is nos. Nos. So how would you say are you going to \\nsee us soon?  Are you going to see us soon?  And we\\'re still speaking informally.S: ¿Vas a ver nos pronto?   \\nT: Very good. ¿Vas a vernos pronto?  Where else could that nos go?  \\nS: At the beginning.  \\nT: Before the changed verb.  \\nS: ¿Nos vas a ver pronto?   \\nT: Very good. ¿Nos vas a ver pronto? Aren\\'t you going to see us soon?   \\nS: ¿No vas a ver pronto - nos pronto?   \\nT: Good. ¿No vas a vernos pronto?   Or ¿No nos vas a ver pronto?  Either way. Why aren\\'t you \\ngoing to see us soon?   \\nS: ¿Por qué no vas a ver nos pronto?   \\nT: Good. So we\\'ve seen that we can use the present to talk about the future using “going to ”, or also \\nusing future context. A word like tomorrow , next week ; next week is “the week that comes\". And \\nthe week  is la semana . La semana. How would you say the w eek that comes ? So what is the word \\nfor that, which is the same as what ?  \\nS: Que.   \\nT: Que. La semana que , the week that, the week which, comes . And here we mean the week comes . \\nSo it\\'s it comes . So what is: it comes ?  \\nS: Vene. Viene.   \\nT: Good. So next week is la semana que viene . The week that comes . La semana que viene.  So you \\ncould say let\\'s speak , and to say let\\'s speak  we know from vamos  you can just use the “we” form. \\nSo to speak  is:  \\nS: Hablar.   \\nT: Hablar. We speak :  \\nS: Hablamos.T: Let\\'s speak next week . Let\\'s speak the week that comes.   \\nS: Hablamos la semana que - And now I\\'ve forgotten come .  \\nT: It\\'s okay. Okay. If we forgot it, we need to find it again. That\\'s not any problem. Every time we do \\nfind it, we strengthen that process. And that\\'s wh at we need, not to remember the word. The process \\nwe need to strengthen. I want you to know how to find to come  and then to go from there. It comes . \\nTake your time to find it comes .  \\nS: Vene.   \\nT: It would be vene  but:  \\nS: Viene.   \\nT: Let\\'s speak the coming week :  \\nS: Hablamos que -  \\nT: At the moment you have the whole sentence in your mind and you want to translate it. Now this \\nprocess works when you\\'re memorizing. But we\\'re not memorizing. We\\'re doing something else; \\nwe\\'re building. So we must reduce it down to the smallest piece we could possibly think about, \\nthink about that piece, get it out, and then forget it. So the first bit is we speak/let\\'s speak :  \\nS: Hablamos.   \\nT: The week :  \\nS: La semana.   \\nT: Which , or that, comes .  \\nS: Que vene - viene .  \\nT: Viene. Good. Hablamos la semana que viene. What was to see , or to view ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: Ver. What is we see ?  \\nS: Vemos.T: Vemos. If you want to say we see each other , you say we see us . Nos can mean us, ourselves, each \\nother , it can mean all of that. Nos. So how do  you say: we see ourselves ?  \\nS: Nos vemos.   \\nT: Nos vemos. This is a way of saying goodbye in Spanish. Nos vemos , we see each other . Now the \\nfuture context here is the fact that you\\'re saying goodbye. But we\\'re using present because we \\nknow when we say nos vemos  we don\\'t mean we\\'re seeing each other right now, we mean we will \\nsee each other again . We\\'re not even mentioning that future context, but it\\'s working. It\\'s allowing \\nus to use the present there. Nos vemos, ciao . Or you might want to say, we w ill see each other next \\nweek . How would you say that? So piece by piece. We see each other.  I want all of your mental \\nenergy on that, and not thinking yet about next week , how you will say that. What you\\'re worried \\nabout right now in this moment is how you \\'re going to say we see ourselves . And even before that, \\njust we see:   \\nS: So it\\'s vemos . And it\\'s nos vemos .  \\nT: Good. The week that comes . So the week :  \\nS: La semana que viene.   \\nT: Good. Nos vemos la semana que viene.  So you see it\\'s not important to reme mber viene . We don\\'t \\nwant to remember viene , this is useless. In fact, if we memorize viene , we\\'re just going to be \\nglazing over the problem. What we want to internalize is the process of “how do I find this\". So, \\nwe\\'ve seen that we can use the present to talk about the future using either ir a: to go to ; voy a, \\nvamos a, va a ; or using some future context.',\n",
       " 'Track 21  \\nT: So, we have seen how we can use the present to talk about the future in Spanish using voy a , vamos \\na, or using some future context ( pront o- soon, mañana - tomorrow , la semana que viene - the \\nweek that comes - next week ).  \\nBut we can also use the present in Spanish to talk about the past, just as we can in English. In \\nEnglish and in Spanish we have three ways to talk about the past, or three m ain ways to talk about \\nthe past. We can say, for example: I ate. We can say: I was eating . And we can say: I have eaten .  \\nNow, when we say I have eaten , we are using I have , which is the present, and then eaten  is like a \\nversion of the verb which is kind o f complicated in English. You say I have eaten , I have gone , I \\nhave wanted . Wanted, eaten, gone, they are all very different. So that is kind of complicated in \\nEnglish, how to build that. But in Spanish it is very simple.  \\nSo, we have: I ate, I was eating , and I have eaten . This I have eaten  is going to be the first past \\nthat we learn. And we are actually using the present. Now, this have  is not tener . Tener  we use \\nfor possession, and we use with the combination of que to give this meaning of \"have to\". Now , \\nthe verb that we use for have  in the sense of I have eaten , I have gone , in Spanish it\\'s haber .  \\nHaber : h-a-b-e-r. And of course we have the silent h there, in haber . Haber  is to have in the sense \\nof I have eaten . But haber  is extremely irregular, there is no “habo” , it is extremely irregular. But \\nthere is a very easy way we can remember all of the versions of haber , even though it is very \\nirregular.  \\nWhat are the two vowel sounds that we have inside of the verb haber ?  \\nS: /a/ and / e/.  \\nT: Good, we have /a/ and / e/ inside the word haber , and we are going to use that to help us remember \\nthe versions. Let\\'s start with he.  \\nS: He.  \\nT: All by itself, it means I have . It is spelled h-e. And of course, we have the silent h there from haber  \\nin he (h-e). I have . We actually saw already one other verb that forms its I version in this way. \\nWhat was to know ?S: Saber .  \\nT: Saber . And I know  is?  \\nS: Sé.  \\nT: Sé. I have  from haber  is spelled h-e, just like sé from saber  is spelled s-e. They are the only two \\nverbs tha t form the I version in this way, in this very irregular way. So you get sé from saber , and \\nyou get he from haber . Different from saber , all of the versions of haber  are irregular.  \\nNow, I and we are connected. We can see how we is the plural of I. I, and then when I include you \\nand I say we, it is like the plural of I. So, I and we are connected. So, just knowing that, if you had \\nto guess what is we have,  knowing that I have is he, what do you think you would guess?  \\nS: Hes?  \\nT: This works with nouns and adjectives. So, it is a very good example of why, whilst we are avoiding \\ngrammatical terminology, we want to know what type of word we are dealing with, because \\ndifferent words behave in different ways. Nouns, words you can put the or a in front of: la sem ana, \\nuna semana - the week, a week ; and adjectives, words that describe, that you can put is in front of: \\nis red, is tall: these words use -s for plural. But we have never seen the verb do that, have we? \\nWhat does the verb use for we?  \\nS: -amos .  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: -emos .  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: -imos .  \\nT: And what do they have in common , -amos, -emos, -imos ?  \\nS: The -mos.  \\nT: Good, ok. So if he is I have  (h-e), how do you think it might be we have ?  \\nS: Hemos .T: Hemos . Good. So, from haber  you get he and hemos , no? And we  don\\'t want to memorise this, \\nlike we said we can think just this thought, just the thought \"What vowels do we have in haber ? \\n/a/ and /e/. Ok: he. He by itself is I, it is connected to we: he and hemos .\"  \\nNow we go to the other vowel / a/. H-a all by itsel f (h-a) ha means she has, it has, he has, you  \\n(formal) have . Now I am sure you can tell me the rest of them. What are the other versions? What \\nis they have ?  \\nS: Han.  \\nT: Good. So, we start with this base of he and ha, and we can remember that just by  looking at the \\nvowels that are inside haber . And then, we can add on what we need. So, we have he for I have , \\nhemos  for we have , we have ha (h-a) for he/she/it/you (formal) have  or has, you added an -n and \\nwhat did you get?  \\nS: Han.  \\nT: And what does that  mean?  \\nS: They have .  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: You guys have .  \\nT: Good. And how would you say you have  informally?  \\nS: Has.  \\nT: Has. Good. And that is your set : he-hemos, ha -has-han. So you have two key vowel sounds /e/ \\nand /a/. He-hemos for I and for we (for I and t he plural of I which is we). And then you have ha \\nfor he-she-it, han for they, has for you (informal). Now we need to learn how to make eaten , how \\nto make gone , how to make wanted , if we want to say I have eaten , I have gone , I have wanted . \\nThis is very si mple in Spanish. -ar verbs will lo se their -ar, they will lo se their final -ar, and they \\nwill put -ado on the end. So for example, we have to speak  which is hablar . If you want to build \\nspoken , you take off that -ar and you put on -ado.  \\nS: Hablado .T: Hablado . Now we can speak about the past. Now we can say I have spoken , and we need to think \\nabout the two bits separately . I have spoken :  \\nS: Is it he? He hablado .  \\nT: Very good. He hablado . I haven\\'t spoken.  Where do you think the no is going to go?  I haven\\'t \\nspoken:   \\nS: In the beginning.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: No he hablado .  \\nT: Very good. No he hablado . I haven\\'t spoken . We have spoken ?  \\nS: Hemos hablado .  \\nT: Hemos hablado . He has spoken :  \\nS: Ha hablado .  \\nT: Good. She has spoken ?  \\nS: Ha hablado .  \\nT: Good. They?  \\nS: Han hablado .  \\nT: You (informal )?  \\nS: Has hablado .  \\nT: Perfect, well done. Now, this is actually more useful, this past, than what you might think it is, \\nbecause this is used even more in Spanish than it is in English. So maybe you want the past I spoke , \\nbut you can use, for now, I have spoken . This \"have past\" is very popular and used much more \\nthan in English. So, how would you say anticipation ?  \\nS: Anticipación .  \\nT: Good, and to anticipate ?S: Anticipar .  \\nT: Good. How would you say we have antic ipated it ? So, there is a few things you have to think \\nabout. Think about them separately, then put them together. We have anticipated it.   \\nS: Hemos anticiparlo .  \\nT: So, to get anticipated  you take away the -ar, and you put -ado.  \\nS: Ah! Yes. Hemos anticip ado lo .  \\nT: And where does that lo go? Because anticipado  is not like -  \\nS: Ah! It has changed now, so it is in the beginning.  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: So, lo hemos anticipado .  \\nT: Good. Lo hemos anticipado . The word for for, like in time, we have anticipated it for a long time  \\nfor example, is por. Por.  \\nS: Por.  \\nT: You might know por favor , which means please  in Spanish. Which means \"for a favour\". Por \\nfavor , \"for a favour\". So this por is also for, in the sense of \"for periods of time.\" So, if you want \\nto say we have anticipated it for a long time , we will just say we have anticipated it for much time . \\nAnd maybe there are some bits in there that you think you don\\'t know. But we will see when we \\nget to them. So, the first bit is we have anticipated it .  \\nS: Lo hemos anti cipado .  \\nT: Good. For:  \\nS: Por.  \\nT: A lot or much :  \\nS: Mucho .T: Time . We saw briefly before that we have a word in English that we use for time, that we only use \\nwith music. What was that word?  \\nS: Tempo .  \\nT: Tempo . And how did it change in Spanish?  \\nS: Tiempo ?  \\nT: Tiempo , yes! The e split. So: we have anticipated it for a long time .  \\nS: Lo hemos anticipado por mucho tiempo .  \\nT: Good. Lo hemos anticipado por mucho tiempo . Very good. Maybe you want to ask somebody \\nDid you celebrate?  And you think \"oh, I  don\\'t know did yet in Spanish\". You can just say: Have \\nyou celebrated ? And that is fine. Like I said, it is used even more in Spanish than in English.  \\nSo, some certain situations it might sound a little bit uncomfortable the translation into English. \\nBut in Spanish, most of the time, it is going to be fine. So, have you celebrated ? Let ’s speak \\ninformally.  \\nS: Has – celebración... celebrar... celebrado.   \\nT: Good, good.  \\nS: So, ¿ has celebrado?   \\nT: Good, ¿ has celebrado ? Haven\\'t you celebrated ?  \\nS: ¿No has ce lebrado ?  \\nT: Why haven\\'t you celebrated ?  \\nS: ¿Por qué no has celebrado ?  \\nT: Good. What was the word for where ?  \\nS: Dónde .  \\nT: Dónde . Where have you celebrated ?  \\nS: ¿Dónde has celebrado ?T: Good. Where have you celebrated it?   \\nS: ¿Dónde lo has celebrado ?  \\nT: Good. So, -ar verbs, we take away the -ar and we put -ado. And we get this version of the verb \\nthat we need after haber , which in English has many different forms. Like I said: you have gone, \\nwanted, eaten...  it changes a lot. But in Spanish we get rid of the -ar and we put -ado. We said that \\nto take , and also sometimes to drink , is tomar . Tomar .  \\nS: Tomar .  \\nT: So how would you say I have taken ?  \\nS: He tomado .  \\nT: He tomado . Good. We have taken :  \\nS: Hemos tomado .  \\nT: Good. Has she taken it ? Has she taken  it?  \\nS: ¿Han lo tomado ?  \\nT: That is a guess, you are looking at me like it is a guess - I want you to establish your own thought \\nprocess of how you are going to find it. So what is the first bit you need to think about? Has she \\ntaken it?   \\nS: Has she .  \\nT: Good. What is that?  \\nS: Ok, so it is he and hemos  for I and we.  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: So it is.. oh! It is ha! It is just ha.  \\nT: Yes. So, has she taken it?   \\nS: ¿Lo ha tomado ?T: Sometimes I am going to build you up step by step, sometimes I am just going to give you the \\nsentence and you need to deconstruct what thoughts you need to have first, and to divide it up into \\nvarious thoughts to get the sentence, resisting any temptation to guess or to say something that we \\nare not sure of. You can be sure and be wrong, t here is no problem there, eh? But we want to think \\nabout it, dividing the sentence up into each individual thing we need to think about. First, she has , \\nha. She has taken , ha tomado . She has taken it . It is lo, where do I put the lo? Before the change d \\nverb. Lo ha tomado .',\n",
       " 'Track 22  \\nT: So, we were learning how we can use the present to talk about the past, using haber , which is to \\nhave , in sentences like I have gone , I have eaten . What do you think terminar  means?  \\nTerminar :  \\nS: To terminate .  \\nT: And what , what verb would we use more commonly in English?  \\nS: Finish ?  \\nT: Finish . Terminar  is to finish . Do you remember how to say I have  from haber ? We can look at \\nthe two vowels we have in haber , and this will set us off.  \\nS: Ah, yes.  \\nT: Ok. So, I have:   \\nS: Is it he or ha?  \\nT: It\\'s he. Good. So, we have :  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Good. How do you spell he?  \\nS: H-e.  \\nT: H-e. Good. And that h comes from haber , that silent h that you have there. Good. So, how would \\nyou say I have finished ? Firstly, how do you make finishe d? How do you get the word finished  \\nfrom terminar ?  \\nS: -ado?  \\nT: Good. So, you have all the information, now you can build the sentence . I have finished :  \\nS: He terminado .  \\nT: Good. He terminado . And I have finished it ? I have finished it :S: He lo term inado .  \\nT: What is the rule about where this lo, la, me, te , can go?  \\nS: It\\'s in the beginning of the sentence, actually, isn\\'t it?  \\nT: This would be a simplification of the rule that you might find unhelpful.  \\nS: Well, if it was in the “to” form it would be at the end.  \\nT: So, after the “to” form or:  \\nS: Or before everything, everything else?  \\nT: Before the changed verb. So this is the way you want to think about it. If we simplify the thought \\nto \"at the beginning or at the end\", when there is other words there, we might be really confused \\nabout where we can put it. So, we must think “after the complete verb ”, the “to” form, or “before \\nthe changed verb ”. So if you say he lo terminado , you ’ve actually got it after a changed verb, you \\nput it after he. So, this is a very rare situation in Spanish, where we have two changed verbs \\ntogether: he terminado . We see, usually after a changed verb we get a complete verb: quiero \\nterminar , I want to finish ; puedo terminar , I can to finish ; debo terminar , I must/ I owe to finish . \\nSo, here we have two changed verbs together, he terminado , weird situation, which means there \\nis only one place it can go.  \\nS: Before the he.  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: It\\'s lo he terminado .  \\nT: Good. Lo he terminado . And I have finished them :  \\nS: Los he  terminado .  \\nT: Los he terminado . So, with -ar verbs, we take of f the -ar and we put -ado. With -er/-ir verbs, we \\ntake away the -er or the -ir and we put -ido to get this form of the verb that we need after haber .  \\nS: Whether it is an -e - there is n o -edo?T: No. Like I said, there is only one difference between -er and -ir verbs, in all of the Spanish \\nlanguage, only one occasion where they are doing things differently and that was in the present for \\nwe. So, for example, we have vender , which means to sell , and how do you say we sell ?  \\nS: Vendemos .  \\nT: Good. And we had venir , to come , and how do you say we come ?  \\nS: Venimos .  \\nT: Venimos . So, we had -emos  and -imos . This is the only time in the whole Spanish language that \\nthese two verbs are do ing something differently. To get this form of the verb that we need after \\nhaber  everything goes to -ido. So vender  becomes?  \\nS: Vendido .  \\nT: Vendido . And venir  become s?  \\nS: Venido .  \\nT: Venido . Now we understand where is bienvenido  from, well-come . Perder , which was to lose , \\nbecomes?  \\nS: Perdido .  \\nT: Perdido . Good. Now we can make some sentences. How do you say I have lost ?  \\nS: He perdido .  \\nT: He perdido . What if you wanted to be emphatic and used the word for I to emphasize?  \\nS: Yo he perdido .  \\nT: Good. Yo he perdido . And, we said that there was a connection between I and we, that we is the \\nplural of I, so this can help us remember that there is a little connection between he for I have  and \\nwe have , which is?  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Hemos . They both use / e/: he, hemos . Good. So how do you say we have lost ?S: Hemos perdido .  \\nT: Hemos perdido . Nosotros . Nosotros  is the word for we, for a male or mixed group. If you are just \\nfemales, what do you think you might say?  \\nS: Nosotras .  \\nT: Nosotras . Good. You pronounced  an s there, which was very good, most English speakers find \\nthemselves accidentally saying / nozotros /, with a z. Not / nozotros/ , but nosotros . It is an s.  \\nNosotros . Or nosotras . So how would you say we have lost,  emphasizing?  \\nS: Nosotras - sorry, nosotro s.  \\nT: Well, it could be.  \\nS: Hemos perdido.   \\nT: Good. Nosotros  or nosotras  (if you are all females) hemos perdido . Good. So, we had he and \\nhemos , and then for the rest of the  versions we go to the other vowel which was in this word \\nhaber .  \\nSo, give me the other versions. Firstly he/she/it/you ( formal) have/has :  \\nS: Ha.  \\nT: So, lets start with that one, how would you say he has lost ?  \\nS: Ha perdido .  \\nT: Good, and if you wanted to clarify or emphasize that it was he and not she, for example?  \\nS: Il?  \\nT: Close, él.  \\nS: Sorry, él.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Él ha perdido .  \\nT: Él ha perdido . And she?S: La?  \\nT: So, you must differentiate between she and her, don\\'t just let that feminine idea come in your mind \\nand pick one of these. You must take the time to deci de which one is it. Is it she or is it her?  \\nS: Ella.  \\nT: Good. So she has lost :  \\nS: Ella ha perdido .  \\nT: Good. You have lost , informally :  \\nS: Has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Now, if you want to emphasize, if you want to say YOU have lost,  the word for you, for \\ninformal, is tú (t-ú). Tú.  \\nS: Tú has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Tú has perdido . What was I love you ?  \\nS: Te quiero .  \\nT: Te quiero . So, what is the difference between tú and te? It is the same as the difference between \\nshe and her, and he and him, only in En glish we don\\'t have two separate words for you and you in \\nthose two different positions. He sees, I see him . So, he sees , we use he. Then I see him , we use \\nhim. This is very intuitive to us in English, we don\\'t think about it. She sees, I see her . There we  \\nhave the same change. But you doesn\\'t change, you see, I see you . So, that might confuse us in \\nSpanish because in English it doesn\\'t change, but all we need to understand is that tú goes in the \\ngroup of él, ella, yo: tú (you); and te is in the group of th ose little words, lo, la, me: te. So, lets \\npractise this. What was to see or to view ?  \\nS: Ver?  \\nT: Ver. And I see is a little bit irregular, do you remember how it was?  \\nS: Veo.  \\nT: So, how would you say I see it,  I see him  or I see you  (formal )?S: Lo veo .  \\nT: Lo veo . Good. I see her  or I see it (feminine thing) or I see you  speaking formally to a female?  \\nS: La veo .  \\nT: La veo . Or how would you say I see them  (females) or I see you  (plural, all females) or I see them  \\n(feminine  objects )?  \\nS: Las veo .  \\nT: Good. And what if they were masculine or mixed objects or people?  \\nS: Los veo .  \\nT: Good. One set of words - we have me for me, we have te for you (informal), we have lo for he, for \\nmasculine object, you (formal) or even for neuter, which kind of just  means  when  something \\ndoesn\\'t have gender, maybe you\\'d say I want to see it  and that it refers to a situation or something \\nlike this, you will use a lot, and then from this the other ones come, but building from lo, so you \\nchange the o to a, to make it fem inine, and you add your -s for plural. Which means one sound is \\nleft in this little set which is us, do you remember how is us?  \\nS: Nos.  \\nT: Nos. Good. So this is one set. Now lets practice the other set. How do you say he sees ?  \\nS: Is it ve?  \\nT: Good. A nd what if you want to clarify or emphasize?  \\nS: Él ve .  \\nT: Él ve . Good. She sees :  \\nS: Ella ve .  \\nT: Ella ve . Good. I see:  \\nS: Yo veo .  \\nT: Good. Now we said the word for we is nosotros , not us, us is nos. We is nosotros . So we see :S: Nosotros vemos .  \\nT: Nosotros vemos . Good. We said that you (informal) was tú. Tú. The you in you see , tú ves .  \\nWhich means that we have also the formal you to learn, which is usted . Usted .  \\nS: Usted .  \\nT: Usted . Which is the formal you, it is actually a contraction of vuestra  merced , which means your \\nhonour . Something like this contracted to usted . So this is the formal you. So how would you say \\nyou see talking formally?  \\nS: Usted ve .  \\nT: Good. You see it  (talking formally) :  \\nS: Lo ve usted ?  \\nT: Or usted lo ve . It can be either  way. The word order in Spanish is much more flexible than in \\nEnglish. Lo ve usted . Usted lo ve . Either way. How would you say you see them  (still talking \\nformally) ? \\nS: Usted ve los .  \\nT: Ok..  \\nS: Sorry! Los ve .  \\nT: Good. Usted los ve . Good. So, usted is flexible. Los is not flexible. Usted los ve . Los ve usted . \\nNow, the word for they, the word for they is ellos  (e-l-l-o-s, and this l-l in most Spanish dialects \\nmakes a / y/ sound. You might hear / ezhos / around Río de la Plata in Buenos Aires of A rgentina; \\nMontevideo, Uruguay. You might hear like a / j/ kind of sound in Colombia /ejos/. But in the great \\nmajority of the Spanish speaking world double l and y make / y/: /eyos/ or / eyas/. I am sure you can \\nwork out the difference between the two. What i s the difference between ellos  and ellas ?  \\nS: Ellos  is for males, or mixed group, and ellas is for females.  \\nT: Good. So, how would you say they see  emphasizing or clarifying that it\\'s they?  \\nS: Ellos  is it ven?T: Yes! Ellos ven . They see them :  \\nS: Ellos  los ven .  \\nT: Ellos los ven . Good. Or we could have had any combination of gender: ellas los ven, ellas las ven, \\nellos las ven , etc. How would you say: they see me ?  \\nS: Ellos me ven .  \\nT: Good. Ellos me ven . So we are understanding that we have two separate  groups of very  \\nimportant words. The set of : yo, él, ella, ellos, ellas, nosotros, tú , and usted . Yo veo. Tú ves. \\nUsted/él/ella ve . Ellos  or ellas ven. And nosotros vemos . Then we have the other set of words - \\nme, lo, la , los, las, nos, te .',\n",
       " \"Track 23  \\nT: So, I want us to run through the forms of haber , this to have  that we use to go into the past. We \\nsaid that we can remember them by looking at the two vowel sounds that we have inside the word \\nhaber . So give me I hav e and we have :  \\nS: He and hemos .  \\nT: Good. And give me the rest of the versions.  \\nS: Ha, has, han.  \\nT: Good. We said that nouns ending a are feminine nouns. So, for example, the house  - la casa . So, \\nwords ending a are feminine. But, words ending ma are masculine. There's a small group of word s \\nthat end ma, which are masculine words. For example, the problem  in Spanish is el problema .  \\nS: El problema.   \\nT: Good. How would you say  Have you understood the problem?  Have you understood the problem?  \\nWhat was to understand?   \\nS: Comprender .  \\nT: Compr ender , good. We can use comprender  or we can use entender . But comprender  is perfect \\nhere as well. Have you understood the problem?  And let's talk formally, to usted .  \\nS: ¿Ha entendido el problema ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Ha entendido el problema ? Good. So, a very comm on error for people learning Spanish \\nis to say la problema . Now, if we look at why these words ending ma are actually masculine, it's \\ngoing to help us internalize it. So these words that end ma actually come from Greek. Problema  \\nin Greek is provlima . Syste m in Greek is systima . In Spanish, it's sistema . So how would you say \\nthe system ?  \\nS: El sistema .  \\nT: El sistema . So it's el. Now in Greek, these words are neuter words. In Greek, you have masculine, \\nfeminine, and neuter. And neuter words in Greek look lik e masculine words. They have a similarword for the. They look kind of like masculine words. So when they went into Spanish, or into \\nLatin, they got mistaken as masculine words. So if we can identify them, there's a key group of \\nwords we can avoid committi ng this error with. If it ends ma, it's probably from Greek and \\nprobably masculine. So how would you say the system  again?  \\nS: El sistema .  \\nT: El sistema . How would you say Have you understood the system?  (talking informally) Have you \\nunderstood the system ?:  \\nS: ¿Has entendido el sistema ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Has entendido el sistema ? Good. Sentir , in Spanish, sentir  is to feel , related to sensation. \\nSo sentir , to feel . And you can also use it like to perceive , in the sense of smell. So, if you wanted \\nto ask,  for example, Have you felt the aroma? it would be a way of asking Have you smelt the \\naroma?  Have you felt it? So how would you say that? Have you felt the aroma?:   \\nS: ¿Has sentido el aroma ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Has sentido el aroma ? Good. So el again. So we have el: el problema , el sistema , el \\nprograma , el aroma , el panorama . El clima , which is a little bit different in English, which \\nmeans climate , el clima . And some others. Have you understood the program ?:  \\nS: ¿Has entendido el programa ?  \\nT: Good. Again, how was to lose ? (Perishable)  \\nS: Perdir .  \\nT: Close .  \\nS: Perder .  \\nT: Perder . Good. So how would you say I have lost ?  \\nS: He perdido .  \\nT: Good. Now what if you wanted to emphasize I have lost ?  \\nS: Yo he perdido .T: Good. Now if you want to say I have got lost , I have got lost , you can just say I have lost myself . \\nWe said that I get ready  is I prepare myself.  Me preparo . We don't use this in Spanish, I get ready . \\nYou say I ready myself . Me preparo . So you don't say I get lost  or I have got lost . You say I have \\nlost myself . So how would you say that?  \\nS: Me he perdido .  \\nT: Again  \\nS: Me he perdido .  \\nT: Yes. When you say it fluently, it doesn't actually sound any different. Which is why I asked for it \\nagain, to make sure that you were putting it. Because the / e/ of me and the / e/ of he will blend \\ntogether. Me he perdido . Ahh. So that means I have lost myself , or I have got lost . Now what if \\nyou wanted to be emphatic as well and say I have lost myself ?  \\nS: Yo me he perdido .  \\nT: Good. Yo me he perdido . How is you h ave lost  (speaking informally)?  \\nS: Has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Has perdido . We said that the word for you in the sense of you lose , you see , not I see you , \\nbut you see , is tú for informal you: tú, t-u.  \\nS: Tú.  \\nT: So how would you say YOU  have lost , being emphatic?  \\nS: Tú ha perdido .  \\nT: There's a bit of a contradiction there.  \\nS: Tú has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Tú has perdido . Good. So just as me can mean me, or myself , te can mean you or yourself . \\nSo how would you say you have got lost , you have lost yoursel f?  \\nS: Te has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Te has perdido . Te has perdido . And what if you wanted to be emphatic as well?S: Tú te has perdido .  \\nT: Good. Tú te has perdido . Very good. What was we have , from haber ?  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Hemos . Good. How would you say we have lost it ? We have lost it :  \\nS: Lo hemos perdido .  \\nT: Lo hemos perdido . Now how would you say we have lost ourselves , or we've got lost ?  \\nS: Nos hemos perdido .  \\nT: Good. Nos hemos perdido . And what if you wanted to say WE have got lost , WE have lost \\nourselves ?  \\nS: Nosotros nos hemos perdido .  \\nT: Good. Nosotros nos hemos perdido . Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 24  \\nT: The word to give in Spanish is dar. D-a-r, dar.  \\nS: Dar.   \\nT: Dar. Good. I give is doy. So it’s like boy ending –oy. Doy.  \\nS: Doy.   \\nT: Good. I give it:   \\nS: Lo doy .  \\nT: Good.  I give them:   \\nS: Los doy .  \\nT: Good. And what if they were feminine things that you are giving?  \\nS: Las doy .  \\nT: Good. How would you say he gives ?  \\nS: Da.  \\nT: Da. He gives , emphasizing he:  \\nS: Él da .  \\nT: Él da . Good. And she g ives:   \\nS: Ella da .  \\nT: Good. How do you say they give?   \\nS: Ellos dan .  \\nT: Good! Ellos dan or ellas for feminine. Ellas dan . Good. You (informal) give?  \\nS: Das.  \\nT: Das. And if you wanted to emphasize this you?S: Tú das.  \\nT: Good. The word for somethin g we said was algo. Algo . So how would you say he is giving me \\nsomething ? He is giving me something :  \\nS: Él me da algo .  \\nT: Good! Él me da algo . They give me something :  \\nS: Me dan algo .  \\nT: Good. Me dan algo . Now if you want to say they give it to me , they give it to me , in Spanish you \\nwould just say they give me it . The personal word me is going to come first and then it is going to \\ncome and the position where they go we know this already. So how would you say they give me \\nit? They give it to me:   \\nS: Me lo  dan.  \\nT: Very good. Me lo dan . Now emphasize or clarify.  \\nS: Ellos me lo dan .  \\nT: Ellos me lo dan . Good. Or ellas if they were female they. Ellas me lo dan . Good. We said that \\nwith some future context we don’t need to use the future. So if you want to say  I will give it to you \\ntomorrow , you could just say I give it to you tomorrow . Lets talk informally, so informally how \\nwill you say I give you it tomorrow ?  \\nS: Te lo doy mañana .  \\nT: Te lo doy mañana . Very common, very Spanish sounding sentence. Te lo  doy mañana , I give \\nyou it tomorrow, sounds strange in English but perfect Spanish. Te lo doy mañana . How would \\nyou say are you giving it to me tomorrow?  And let’s speak formally , so complicated sentence in \\nEnglish. Are you giving it to me tomorrow ? What  we have to do in Spanish is just work out who \\nis doing what. You work out who is doing what and to who and we build that, it's very simple in \\nSpanish. Complicated sentence in English but not in Spanish. Talking formally, are you giving it \\nto me tomor row?:  \\nS: Well it’s da.T: That’s the first thing you should work out, good.  \\nS: ¿Me lo da mañana ?  \\nT: Good. Now what if you wanted to emphasize you. Are YOU  giving it to me tomorrow ?:  \\nS: And  usted  can come in the beginning or the end?  \\nT: Yeah.  \\nS: So ¿usted me lo da mañana?   \\nT: ¿Usted me lo da mañana ? ¿Me lo da usted mañana ? ¿Me lo da mañana usted ? These words \\nusted, yo, él , ella are extremely flexible for different emphasis. Again it’s not something we want \\nto teach here, because those nuances of emphasis change depending on the dialect , and it’s \\nsomething that you pick up in real life because where people mov e it around is accompanied with \\na change in the voice and hand expressions and you understand in this case intuitively which is \\nemphatic. You guys is usted  but plural. Now if the word ends in a consonant in Spanish, you don’t \\njust add –s, you add –es. So how would it sound, you guys ?  \\nS: Ustedes .  \\nT: Ustedes . Good. So now let’s say will you guys give it to us tomorrow?  So again we just wanna  \\nwork out who is doing and to who or to what are they doing and then we can construct it. So, are \\nyou guys giving it to us tomorrow?:   \\nS: So it’s dan.  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: It’s nos and it’s still lo.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: ¿Nos lo dan mañana ?  \\nT: Good. Now this could  mean you guys  or they give it to us tomorrow . Now what if you wanted to \\nclarify that it was you guys ?  \\nS: ¿Ustedes nos lo dan mañana?T: Good. ¿Ustedes nos lo dan mañana? ¿Nos lo dan mañana ustedes? ¿Nos lo dan ustedes \\nmañana?  How do you say I want  to give ? I want to give:   \\nS: Quiero dar .  \\nT: Good. I want to give you it , talking informally. Informally, I want to give it to you :  \\nS: Quiero das .  \\nT: Work out the verbs first. I want to give , work that out first.  \\nS: Oh! Quiero dar .  \\nT: Good, to give you is something else, it’s not you give . I want to give , quiero dar , it to you :  \\nS: So it’s lo and it’s te.  \\nT: Good. And in what order do they come?  \\nS: It's te lo quiero dar .  \\nT: Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 25  \\nT: So we’ve seen how me can mean me, to me or myself and te can mean you, to you or yourself . And \\nnos can mean us, to us or ourselves . So we want to resist the temptation to translate this to. So for \\nexample: he speaks to me , we don’t need this to because me, me, can mean me, to me or myself . \\nSo we w ant to resist the temptation to translate that to. So how do you say: he speaks to me or he \\nis speaking to me ?  \\nS: Habla me . Sorry, me habla.   \\nT: Yeah, don’t let that to confuse you about the position it should go. It’s still going before, me habla . \\nThey speak to me :  \\nS: Me hablan .  \\nT: Good! If you want to say they speak to me about it , you can just  say they speak me it in Spanish.  \\nS: Me lo hablan .  \\nT: Me lo hablan . Very good. They are speaking to me about it . So this to and this about  we notice \\nSpanish  tends not to need these words as much as English does. For example to buy was comprar , \\ncomprar .  \\nS: Comprar .  \\nT: Good. So this me other than to me can be for me , from me , we don’t really need these words. So  \\nfor example,  if we want to say he buys i t for me we can just say he buys me it . So comprar  is to \\nbuy. He buys it for me , he buys me it :  \\nS: Me lo compra .  \\nT: Good. Me lo compra . So here we see me is like for me here but it’s just me, we are just using me. \\nI buy it for you , speaking informally.  I buy it for you :  \\nS: Te lo compro .T: Good. Te lo compro . Now, if you want to say shall I buy it for you,  shall  in English, all it\\'s doing \\nreally is just making it a question. Shall I buy it for you?  So in Spanish just make it sound like a \\nquestio n.  \\nS: ¿Te lo compro ?  \\nT: Yeah! ¿ Te lo compro ? Shall I buy it for you?  Now this could actually even mean from you . Shall \\nI buy it from you? So by the context we will understand the difference. Maybe you will hear if you \\ntravel to a Spanish speaking country  people say “buy me\", selling things in the street. “Buy me \\nsomething” is what you will hear. And they are probably not asking you to buy them something \\nbut to buy something from them. And it’s understood and we don’t really need to use these words \\nlike from  or for most of the time. To do was hacer , hacer . How would you say do you want to do  \\n(speaking informally) ?  \\nS: Hacer  is an irregular verb.  \\nT: It doesn’t matter, does it? Do you want to do ?:  \\nS: Ah! ¿ Quieres hacer ?  \\nT: Good. Do you want to do it?   \\nS: ¿Quieres hacerlo ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Quieres hacerlo ? Now how do you think you would say: do you want to do it for me? :  \\nS: ¿Me lo quieres hacer ?  \\nT: Yes. ¿ Me lo quieres hacer ? So, we are not using the word for for. We don’t need it in Spanish, \\nit’s understoo d. Do you want to do it for me? ¿ Me lo quieres hacer ? ¿Quieres hacérmelo ? Good. \\nThe kitchen in Spanish is la cocina , /la cosina/, or in most of Spain, /la cothina/. La cocina .  \\nS: La cocina .  \\nT: And to cook is cocinar . You just make a verb from cocina, cocinar . Actually this is where we get \\nconcoction , concoction  from in English, “with cooking”. So how would you say I cook  from \\ncocinar ?  \\nS: Cocino .T: Good. How do you say he cooks or she cooks or it cooks or usted , you (formal) cook ?  \\nS: Cocina .  \\nT: Good. You (informal )?  \\nS: Cocinas .  \\nT: Good. And with emphasis or clarification if you want to use the word for you?  \\nS: Usted .  \\nT: But this is informal, cocinas .  \\nS: Ah sorry! Tú cocinas .  \\nT: Tú cocinas . Good. They cook or you guys ?  \\nS: Cocinan .  \\nT: Go od. What if you wanted to use the word for they, to emphasize or to clarify?  \\nS: Ellos cocinan .  \\nT: Ellos cocinan . Good. Or ellas if it’s a female group. Or if you wanted to say you guys are cooking  \\nwith the emphasis or the clarification?  \\nS: Ustedes cocin an.  \\nT: Good. Ustedes cocinan . And we cook ? What is we cook ?  \\nS: Cocinamos .  \\nT: Good. And with the emphasis or the clarification?  \\nS: Nosotros cocinamos .  \\nT: Good. Nosotros cocinamos . Good. How would you say I can ? How is I can , related to power ?  \\nS: Puedo .  \\nT: Puedo . Good. And he can :  \\nS: Puede .T: Good. Puede . And you can (informal):  \\nS: Puedes .  \\nT: Good. Can you cook? :  \\nS: ¿Puedes cocinar ?  \\nT: Good. Can you cook something for me?  So what was the word for something ?  \\nS: Algo .  \\nT: Good. How do you thi nk you are gonna say this in Spanish? Can you cook something for me? :  \\nS: ¿Me puedes cocinar algo ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Me puedes cocinar algo ? ¿Puedes cocinarme algo ? Either way. So how would you say \\nI have cooked ? I have cooked :  \\nS: He cocinado .  \\nT: He cocinado . Good. So we said that this tense of have cooked , I have cooked  instead of I cooked,  \\nwe can use it more in Spanish than in English. So for example in English i t sounds much more \\nnatural to say I cooked at 6 o’clock , but in Spanish it’s not a problem to sa y I have cooked at 6 \\no’clock . So, at 6 o’clock  is a las seis . What you actually mean when you say a las seis  is a las seis \\nhoras . “At the six hours”. A little bit like in English when you say “at sixteen hundred hours\". A \\nlas seis . So how would you say I have cooked at 6 o’clock ? I cooked at 6 o’clock :  \\nS: He cocinado a las seis .  \\nT: Good. He cocinado a las seis . I have cooked at six o’clock . I cooked at six o’clock . Good. The \\nword for eight  in Spanish is ocho . Ocho .  \\nS: Ocho .  \\nT: Ocho . We have this similar  root in octagon , you know , a shape with eight sides. Or octopus,  which \\nhas eight legs. Or in October , which, well now it’s the tenth month, in the Roman calendar there \\nwere only ten months and October was month number eight. So, ocho , eight . How would yo u say \\nwe have cooked at eight o’clock ? We have cooked at eight o’clock :S: Hemos cocinado a las ocho .  \\nT: Good. Hemos cocinado a las ocho . The word for nine in Spanish is nueve .  \\nS: Nueve .  \\nT: We can see in November , which used to be the ninth month. Th e o splits into ue, nueve . And we \\nhave the same with ten. Ten is diez or /dieth / in most of Spain. Diez. What does that sound like, if \\nyou go back to our calendar?  \\nS: December ?  \\nT: December , which used to be the tenth month and of course again an example of splitting. Dec to \\ndiez. Quedar  in Spanish, quedar , means to remain , or to be left over and it actually has quite a \\nfew other meanings as well, it’s quite a flexible verb, quedar . But for now, to remain or to be left \\nover. Q-u-e-d-a-r. Quedar . And q-u in Spanish is always a k sound. You must resist any temptation \\nto pronounce / qwedar /, if you were to read this. The word que, the word for what  that we learned \\nis spelled q-u-e. Quiero  is spelled q-u-i-e-r-o. So q-u this combination is always a k. Quedar \\nmeans to remain . So in Spanish if you want to say I stay  actually you say I remain myself . This is \\nthe way you say I stay  in Spanish. So we start with remain  which is quedar . So how do you say I \\nremain ?  \\nS: Quiedo .  \\nT: It doesn’t split here but good fo r trying.  \\nS: Quedo ?  \\nT: Quedo . I remain myself ?  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: Me quedo . This means I stay . Me quedo . Until , until in Spanish is hasta . Hasta . H-a-s-t-a. You \\nmay have heard hasta la vista . Until the view , literally until the seeing , until we see each other . \\nHasta la vista . So now you can say I am staying here until ten o’clock . So let’s divide it up. I am \\nstaying here, I remain myself here:   \\nS: Me quedo aquí.T: Until ?  \\nS: Hasta .  \\nT: Ten o’clock . So-  \\nS: Las diez .  \\nT: Yes. Las diez . It’s literal ly like las diez horas , but you don’t say horas . Maybe historically people \\nsaid it , but not anymore. Me qu edo aquí , or acá, hasta las diez . Good. I am staying until ten \\no’clock . So if me quedo , I remain myself is I am staying , how do you think you would say we are \\nstaying ?  \\nS: Nos quedemos .  \\nT: Good , but now you have some vowel harmony popping in because we were concentrating on the \\nother bit , so this mistake managed to come back.  \\nS: Quedamos ?  \\nT: Good! Because it’s  quedar . No? Nos quedamos . We rem ain ourselves . We stay . So we are staying \\nuntil nine o’clock :  \\nS: Nos quedamos hasta las nueve .  \\nT: Good. Nos quedamos hasta las nueve . Very good. Very good. You stay or you remain yourself  \\n(speaking informally) :  \\nS: Te quedas .  \\nT: Good. Te quedas . You ar e staying here :  \\nS: Te quedas aquí.  \\nT: Te quedas aquí. Are you staying here? :  \\nS: ¿Te quedas aquí ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Te quedas aquí ? How would you make it emphatic now? Are YOU  staying here?  \\nBecause this te is not emphatic, it is not optional. Yo u have to put this me in me quedo  to get themeaning of stay and we have to put this te in te quedas  to get the meaning of stay. But if we \\nwant to make it emphatic, what do we add?  \\nS: Tú te quedas ?  \\nT: Good. I am staying , emphatic.  \\nS: Yo me quedo .  \\nT: Go od. Yo me quedo . Good. We are staying :  \\nS: Nos quedamos .  \\nT: Nos quedamos . Good. WE are staying :  \\nS: Nosotros nos quedamos .  \\nT: Nosotros nos quedamos . Very good.',\n",
       " 'Track 26  \\nT: So again, You\\'re staying here . Let\\'s make that. You\\'re staying here , informal.  \\nS: Te quedas aquí .  \\nT: Good. Te quedas aquí . You\\'re not staying here :  \\nS: No te quedas aquí .  \\nT: No te quedas aquí . Or acá. Now, if you want to make that a question, Aren\\'t you staying here? :  \\nS: ¿No te quedas aquí ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ No te quedas aquí ? Why aren\\'t you staying here? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no te quedas aquí ?  \\nT: Very good. What was I go or I\\'m going ? (I\\'m going on a voyage .)  \\nS: Voy.  \\nT: Voy. Good. So, how do you think you would say I\\'m going to stay , I\\'m going to remain myself ?  \\nS: Voy a quedarme .  \\nT: Good. Until seven, until seven o\\'clock . Seven  is siete , similar to the beginning of September . \\nSeptember  in Spanish actually is either Septiembre  or Setiembre . You have two versions of it in \\nSpanish, Septiembre  with the p, or without the p, Setiembre . And you can see how siete  is like \\nthe beginning “set” with the split of the e. So, I\\'m going to stay , I\\'m going to remain myself until \\nseven o\\'clock . I\\'m going to stay until seven o\\'clock:   \\nS:  Voy a quedarme hasta las siete .  \\nT: Good. Voy a quedarme hast a las siete . Very good. How do you say I want to stay ?  \\nS: Quiero quedarme .  \\nT: Good. Quiero quedarme . Do you want to stay?  Let\\'s talk informally. Do you want to stay? :  \\nS: ¿Quieres quedarte ?T: Good. Very good. ¿ Quieres quedarte ? Do you want to remain yourself?  What was I must  or I \\nowe?  \\nS: Debo .  \\nT: Debo . Good. What is we owe  or we must ? And the \"to\" form is deber . Deber , to owe . So we:  \\nS: Debemos .  \\nT: Good. We must stay . So, We owe to remain ourselves . We must stay:   \\nS: Debemos quedarme , quedarnos .  \\nT: Good. Debemos quedarnos . Of course this nos or me or te can come at the beginning as well. \\nNos debemos quedar , debemos quedarnos . Good. What was I have , in the sense of possession?  \\nSo not haber , the other \"have\"?  \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo . So, if we add on que to tengo , we get the meaning of have to , which is just like debo , but \\nless serious sounding. Just like in English. I must stay  sounds a little bit more serious than I have \\nto stay . And that difference in register, how it feels, is the same in Spanish. So how do you say I \\nhave to stay ?  \\nS: Tengo que quedarme .  \\nT: Good. And how would you say You have to stay , speaking informally?  \\nS: Tienes que quedarte .  \\nT: Tienes que quedarte . Good. You have to stay here , informally still:  \\nS: Tienes que quedarte aquí .  \\nT: Good. I want to know why you have to stay here . I want to know . First bit: don\\'t think about the \\nwhole sentence, just think of I want:   \\nS: Quiero saber .  \\nT: Good. Quiero saber . Now forget that bit. Why:S: Por qué.  \\nT: You have to stay here :  \\nS: Tienes que quedarte aquí .  \\nT: Good. Very good. Quiero saber por  qué tienes que quedarte aquí . Good. What was I can , or I \\nhave the power to ?  \\nS: Puedo .  \\nT: Puedo . Good. I can stay:   \\nS: Puedo quedarme .  \\nT: Good. Puedo quedarme . I can\\'t stay :  \\nS: No puedo qued arme .  \\nT: Good. No puedo quedarme . Do you remember how to say tonight , or this night ?  \\nS: Esta noche .  \\nT: Esta noche . Good. I can\\'t stay tonight:   \\nS: No puedo quedarme esta noche .  \\nT: Good. No puedo quedarme esta noche . The \"to\" form of can is poder , poder. And this o is \\nsplitting when we stress it and say puedo . Poder . So how would you say we can  or we are able ?  \\nS: Podemos .  \\nT: Podemos . Very good. We can stay :  \\nS: Podemos quedarnos .  \\nT: Podemos quedarnos . We can\\'t stay tonight:   \\nS: No podemos quedarno s esta noche .  \\nT: Good. No podemos quedarnos esta noche . What was to think  or to be pensive ? To think:   \\nS: Pensar .T: Good. Pensar . We think:   \\nS: Pensamos .  \\nT: Good. You think  (informal) :  \\nS: Pensas .  \\nT: Good, it should be pensas , should -  \\nS: Piensas .  \\nT: Good. Piensas . What do you think? :  \\nS: ¿Qué piensas ?  \\nT: ¿Qué piensas ? Good. Now, if we want to say Do you plan on staying here tonight?  we can just \\nsay Do you think to stay here tonight?  Ah? Do you think to stay here tonight?  So how would we \\nsay this, informally?  \\nS: ¿Piensas quedarte aquí esta noche ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Piensas quedarte aquí esta noche ? Very good. Now how would you say I have stayed?  \\nI have stayed , or I have remained myself, I have stayed :  \\nS: He quedado me, He me quedado   \\nT: I don\\'t want you  to guess and see what feels good. So with logic you want to place it. And if you\\'re \\nwrong, it\\'s fine, because if you got there through a fault of logic, you\\'ll change the logic through \\nthat mistake. So tell me the rule about where that me can go.  \\nS: It g oes after the \"to\" form.  \\nT: Mmm.  \\nS: And before everything else.  \\nT: Before the changed verb. It\\'s very important the way we instruct ourselves. Now I\\'m giving you \\nalways the simplest way that we can instruct ourselves accurately. If I tell you \"before th e verb\" \\nand you tell yourself \"at the beginning\", you lose something. Ah, you lose a certain clarity.S: Because nouns might come into the sentence and then -  \\nT: Exactly. We have stayed, we have remained ourselves:   \\nS: Nos hemos quedado .  \\nT: Very good. Nos hemos quedado . We haven\\'t stayed:   \\nS: No nos hemos quedado .  \\nT: Very good. No nos hemos quedado . You have stayed  (informal). You have stayed:   \\nS: Te has quedado .  \\nT: Good. Te has quedado . Make it a question, Have you stayed? :  \\nS: ¿Te has quedado ?  \\nT: Goo d. And let\\'s be emphatic now, let\\'s say the word for you.  \\nS: ¿Tú te has quedado ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Tú te has quedado ? Let\\'s make it negative now. Haven\\'t you stayed?:   \\nS: ¿Tú no te has quedado ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Tú no te has quedado ? Good. Llamar , in Spanish, is to ca ll, or to phone , to telephone , \\nllamar . l-l, which we said is pronounced like y in most of the Spanish speaking world. To call .  \\nS: Llamar .  \\nT: How do you say I call ?  \\nS: Llamo .  \\nT: Llamo . If you want to introduce yourself, instead of saying My name is , in Spanish it\\'s much more \\ncommon to say I call myself .  \\nS: Me llamo .  \\nT: Me llamo . And then you can introduce yourself. Me llamo Mihalis , for example. How would you \\nsay You call yourself  (informal) ?S: Te llamas .  \\nT: Good. Te llamas . If you want to ask t he name, you will say How  do you call yourself? And the \\nword for how is cómo . Cómo .  \\nS: Cómo .  \\nT: So how do you say How do you call yourself? :  \\nS: ¿Cómo te llamas ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Cómo te llamas ? You might have heard this around and not understood actually how it\\'s \\nbeing constructed. Now we understand it. It\\'s How do you call yourself? ¿Cómo te llamas ?',\n",
       " 'Track 27  \\nT: How would you say the situation  in Spanish?  \\nS: La situación .  \\nT: Good. -ión is a feminine ending, so the word takes la for the. La situación . Good.  Now in Spanish, \\nadjectives are describing words. Adjectives are words that describe, like big or yellow  or happy . \\nWords that we can put is in front of are adjectives, describing words. These words come after the \\nnoun they describe in Spanish. So instead o f saying, “the global situation\" for example, you say \\n“the situation global\". There\\'s a bit of flexibility for emphasis as well, but the normal standard \\nposition is to come after the noun. So how would you say the global situation ?  \\nS: La situación globa l.  \\nT: Good. La situación global . How would you say digital camera ? Digital camera :  \\nS: Cámara digital .  \\nT: Yeah. Cámara digital . Good. Cámara  is feminine, so a digital camera  is una cámara digital .  \\nSo we have la for the, and una for a. So how would you s ay, I want to buy a digital camera ? What \\nwas the verb to buy ?  \\nS: Comprar .  \\nT: Good. So I want to buy a digital camera :  \\nS: Quiero comprar una cámara digital .  \\nT: Good. Quiero comprar una cámara digital . How would you say I want to buy the digital camera ?  \\nS: Quiero comprar la cámara digital .  \\nT: Good. Quiero comprar la cámara digital . What if you wanted to say, I want to buy it  and with \\nthe it, you meant the digital camera?  \\nS: Quiero comprarla .T: Good. So this la is it. There\\'s a lot of words in Spa nish for car depending on where you are. It\\'s \\none of the words that changes a lot between the dialects, but I think everybody understands all of \\nthe words that are heard. You might hear coche , which is related to coach ; carro , which of course \\nis car, carro , so we have two r\\'s in carro , that\\'s why we have this rolling r. You might hear auto , \\nwhere do you think auto  comes from?  \\nS: Automobile .  \\nT: Of course, and it exists: automóbil . But people will say auto . You might even hear máquina , \\nwhich means machine . So machine , the car , máquina . This is another example of the q-u spelling \\nproducing k sound. M-a-q-u-i-n-a. Máquina .  \\nS: Máquina .  \\nT: Good. So there\\'s a few words there for car, and you might hear others as well. Coche  is masculine, \\nso how would you say the car ?  \\nS: El coche .  \\nT: Good. A for masculine words is un. U-n. Un. So, a car :  \\nS: Un coche .  \\nT: The machine ? Does máquina  look masculine or feminine?  \\nS: Feminine.  \\nT: Good. So the machine :  \\nS: La máquina .  \\nT: La máquina . A machine :  \\nS: Una máquina .  \\nT: Good. And does carro  look masculine or feminine?  \\nS: Masculine.  \\nT: Good. So the car :S: El carro .  \\nT: El carro . A car :  \\nS: Un carro .  \\nT: Un carro . Good. So it\\'s the noun that has the gender, not the object. Of course it\\'s no t the car that \\nis masculine or feminine, it\\'s the noun, it’s the word itself. So even though all of these words refer \\nto car, some are masculine and some are feminine. Big, in Spanish, is grande, grande . Of course \\nwe can relate this to grand  in English, grande . So using any of these words that you like, how \\nwould you say, the big car ?  \\nS: La máquina grande .  \\nT: Good. La máquina grande . So la máquina grande , el auto grande . Now if you say  the big cars , \\nthis adjective is also going to become plural. How do  you say  the house ?  \\nS: La casa .  \\nT: Good. And how was the houses ?  \\nS: Las casas .  \\nT: Good, so la also became plural. So las casas , if you say the big houses , big is also going to become \\nplural.  \\nS: Grandes .  \\nT: So how would you say the big houses ?  \\nS: Las casas grandes .  \\nT: Good. Las casas grandes . The big car , using auto :  \\nS: El auto grande .  \\nS: Good. El auto grande . The cars , using auto , so a masculine word, you say los autos . So el \\nbecomes los in plural. So how would you say the big cars ?  \\nS: Los autos grandes .T: Los autos  grandes.  Los carros grandes . Good. If you want to say Can you see the big car?  you \\ncan say, can you see ?, or in Spanish you can just say, do you see ? We kind of overuse this can a \\nlot in English. So, Do you see the big car? :  \\nS: You informal? ¿Ves el coche grande ?  \\nT: Good. You needed some time there to look at ves. And this was the more common way actually, \\nof saying it in Spanish: ¿ Ves el auto grande ? But, if you didn\\'t have that time to think about it, \\neven though  it\\'s more natural to say it like this it really doesn\\'t matter; you can say can you see…  \\nNow you would probably be quicker at building can you see  than you see  because can is something \\nvery common that you\\'re going to be using all the time. So in conversa tion, where you just want \\nto get the meaning across, you might want to use this. So how would you say  can you see the big \\ncar?:  \\nS: ¿Puedes ver el coche grande ?  \\nT: Good. So puedo, quiero, tengo que, debo , these verbs that are followed by two versions tha t \\nyou\\'re going to be using a lot, even though the sentence is longer, they are short cuts. They are \\nshort cuts in thought. And once you become very confident with that, you\\'re going to start noticing \\nthat people say things differently to you. So instea d of I can\\'t find it, I don\\'t find it . You will notice \\nthat yourself and your speech will adjust, but in the beginning what you\\'re trying to do is to be \\nconversational and correct structurally. Once you get over that hurdle of being communicative, \\nyou\\'re going to start noticing that people say things differently to you. So instead of I can\\'t find it , \\nI don\\'t find it . So you could say, I can\\'t find it . How would you say I can\\'t find it ? What was to \\nfind, or to encounter ?  \\nS: Encontrar .  \\nT: Encontr ar. So say  I can\\'t find it:   \\nS: No puedo encontrarlo .  \\nT: Good. No puedo encontrarlo . This would be the short cut even though it\\'s longer, it\\'s much easier \\nto build no puedo encontrarlo  because puedo  is something you\\'re going to be using all the time, \\nand encontrar  is in the “to\" form. I don\\'t find it , how would that be?  \\nS: No lo encuentro .T: No lo encuentro . Good. So it\\'s very useful to bear in mind these verbs like puedo, debo , which \\nwe can use with “to\" forms which give us a short cut and allow us to get conversational very \\nquickly. What was to remain ?  \\nS: Quedar .  \\nT: Quedar . Good. And I remain myself  is how we get the meaning of I stay . So how do you say I \\nstay?  \\nS: Quedarme .  \\nT: I remain myself . I remain myself . What\\'s to remain ?  \\nS: Qued ar.  \\nT: What\\'s I remain ?  \\nS: Quedo .  \\nT: Uh -huh. What\\'s I remain myself ?  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: What was happening?  \\nS: I was thinking “okay the me should go first, but it can\\'t go first because the verb is in the ’to’ form ”. \\nAnd I just got stuck.  \\nT: Well  you start when you\\'re building the sentence with the verb. With who\\'s doing that. So if you \\nstart with that, then it\\'s not in the “to\" form anymore. The order of thought is very important; the \\nverb is the backbone. That\\'s the first place you want to go: quedo . I remain myself : me quedo . So \\nme quedo is I stay . The word for red in Spanish is rojo. Rojo.  This is spelled r-o-j-o. And j\\'s in \\nSpanish are pronounced / kh/. Like this, rojo.  \\nS: Rojo .  \\nT: And we have the initial r, so if you can do it, it will be th e rolling r. Rojo .  \\nS: Rojo .T: Good. So how would you say I\\'m staying in the red car ? I\\'m staying in the car red . The word for \\nin is en. E-n. So let\\'s divide it up: I\\'m staying , only think about that bit. I\\'m staying , I remain myself :  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: In:  \\nS: En.  \\nT: The red car, the car red . And let\\'s use the word auto  for car for now. So I\\'m staying in the red car, \\nthe car red :  \\nS: Me quedo en el auto rojo .  \\nT: Good. Me quedo en el auto rojo . Good. How would you say I have stayed in the red car ? I have \\nstayed, I have remained myself in the red car . Again we want to divide it up. I have remained \\nmyself . There\\'s a lot to think about there, in that first bit.  \\nS: Me he quedado .  \\nT: Uh -huh. In the red car :  \\nS: En el auto rojo .  \\nT: Good. How would y ou say I have bought a red car? What is the verb to buy ?  \\nS: Comprer .  \\nT: Comprar .  \\nS: Comprar . Comprar .  \\nT: Comprar .  \\nT: So I have bought a red car , and let\\'s use auto .  I have bought a red car:   \\nS: He comprado un auto rojo .  \\nT: Good. He comprado un,  (masculi ne word), un, un auto rojo . How would you say I have bought \\nmyself a red car ?  \\nS: Me he comprado un auto rojo .T: Me he comprado un auto rojo . I have bought myself a red car . Very good.',\n",
       " \"Track 28  \\nT: Spanish dialects don't change very much. Slang changes a lot, but Spanish is pretty standard. It's \\nnot like Arabic for example, where you have such a different Arabic in Morocco to Egypt, for \\nexample. All of the different Spanishes are completely mutually intelligible. But in slang, you get \\nmany differ ent terms and words and car is one of these words that have different versions. Money  \\nis another one. You might hear dinero , which is like the standard word; you might hear plata , \\nwhich actually means silver; pasta  you might hear pasta , that's one they  use that in Spain. So we \\nhad a few words for car. Do you remember any of them?  \\nS: Máquina , auto , caro.  \\nT: Carro . Two r's. Let's stay with carro . How would you say the car ?  \\nS: El carro .  \\nT: El carro . And how would you say, a car ?  \\nS: Un carro .  \\nT: Un carro . Good. So it's a masculine word, and we use el for the, and un for a. What if we say, the \\ncars?  \\nS: Los carros .  \\nT: Good. Los carros . So the plural of el is los. It's a little bit different, el to los. The word for expensive  \\nis caro . So it 's like carro , but with one r. Caro .  \\nS: Caro .  \\nT: So again it's a nice bit to feel the difference between having the single r and the double r, just as \\nwe saw in pero , meaning but and perro  meaning dog. So how would you say, the car is expensive ?  \\nS: El carro es caro .  \\nT: Good. El carro es caro . Good. So es we said was it is, she is, he is or just is. Or you are , talking \\nto usted . Talking formally. So if you just wanted to say it is expensive :  \\nS: Es caro .T: Good. And what if you were talking about a f eminine thing?  \\nS: Es cara .  \\nT: Es cara . And when I say feminine thing I really mean a feminine noun. If you're referring in your \\nmind to a feminine noun, because if you, in your country, call cars máquinas , then you're going \\nto say es cara . But if you cal l them autos,  then you're going to say es caro . So it refers to the word \\nmore than the object, to the noun, the gender of the noun. So es we have for is, and for they are , \\nor you guys are - we know they always come together - we have son. Son. S-o-n.  \\nS: Son.  \\nT: Son. So if you want to say the cars are expensive , and we will use carro  again. So the cars are \\nexpensive :  \\nS: Los carros son caro - caros .  \\nT: Good. Los carros son caros . Good. What if you use a feminine word like máquina , how's it going \\nto be? The cars are expensive :  \\nS: Las máquinas son caras .  \\nT: Good. Las máquinas son caras . And the car is expensive : Using again máquina .  \\nS: La máquina es caro  - cara.  \\nT: Good. La máquina es cara . The word teacher  in Spanish is professor . Profesor .  \\nS: Profeso r.  \\nT: Profesor . So how would you say, he is a professor ? And we don't need to say “a”, we can just say \\nhe is professor.   \\nS: Es profesor .  \\nT: Good. Es profesor . What if you wanted to say, she is a professor ? What do you think might \\nhappen?  \\nS: Es profe sora?T: Good. Es profesora . What if you wanted to say, they are teachers , and you mean a group of \\nfemales?  \\nS: Son profesoras .  \\nT: Son profesoras . Good. So, this is a noun, profesor . It's a word you can put the or a in front of. \\nNow, we said that adjecti ves, they change for gender if they end in -o. If they don't, they don't.  \\nFor example, the global situation  was:  \\nS: La global situación .  \\nT: Where does that global  go?  \\nS: La situación global .  \\nT: La situación global . So situación  is feminine, but we're not saying “ globala ”. Adjectives, these \\ndescribing words that we can put is in front of, they only change if they end in -o. But nouns, they \\ncan change to feminine like profesor/profesora  to differentiate. So this is why it's important to \\nknow what type of  word we're dealing with. We're doing this already, but we don't even realize it. \\nThe moment we come in contact with a verb, we know exactly what to do. We know it's a verb, \\nand we know how to manage it. We don't start trying to make a verb masculine or fe minine, for \\nexample. So we are already making this differentiation, but we want to do it more consciously to \\nget more control. So this is a noun. Doctor , what do you think that means?  \\nS: Doctor .  \\nT: Good. Is it a noun, is it an adjective, is it a verb? Wh at is it?  \\nS: Noun.  \\nT: Noun. So how do you think feminine, a female doctor, will be?  \\nS: Doctora ?  \\nT: Good. Doctora . We just stick an a. Good. So how would you say he is a doctor ?  \\nS: Es doctor .  \\nT: Good. She is a doctor :S: Es doctora .  \\nT: Good. Now, if you want to get the plural of professor , profesor , or doctor , doctor , or any other \\nword in Spanish that ends in a consonant, you don't add s; you add -es. so how do you think it \\nwould sound, the plural of profesor ?  \\nS: Profesores .  \\nT: Good. Profesores . So this is the plural for masculine or for mixed. The plural for feminine:  \\nS: Profesoras .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say they are professors ? And you mean a masculine or mixed group.  \\nS: Son profesores .  \\nT: Good. Son profesores . And if they were all fem ale?  \\nS: Son profesoras .  \\nT: Good. They are doctors : mixed or masculine:  \\nS: Son doctores .  \\nT: Good. Son doctores . What if they were females?  \\nS: Son doctoras .  \\nT: Good. Son doctoras . Good. Words ending -ive in English, i-v-e, tend to become -ivo, i-v-o for \\nmasculine singular. This is the one we always start from though and build from, this masculine \\nsingular, or neuter let's say. So for example addictive  becomes adictivo . Now when I say neuter, \\nwe don't really have a neuter in Spanish, we have masculi ne and feminine. But the concept of \\nneuter exists. For example , if I say  it's addictive , and I'm referring to living in the mountains, is \\naddictive ; eating  health ily is addictive  or something like this, then I use the masculin e singular.  \\nSo how would you say it's addictive ?  \\nS: Es adictivo .  \\nT: Good. Es adictivo . How would you say he is positive ?S: Es positivo .  \\nT: Good. And you pronounced an s where  most English speakers will probably find themselves \\npronouncing a z there because in English we have positive , so that would probably transfer into \\nSpanish to /pozitivo / and we want to be careful not to do that. Positivo  with an s. Positivo. She is \\npositive :  \\nS: Es positiva .  \\nT: Good. They are positive :  \\nS: Son posi tivos .  \\nT: Good. They are intuitive :  \\nS: Son intuitivos .  \\nT: Good. Son intuitivos . What if you meant women?  \\nS: Intuitivas .  \\nT: Good. Son intuitivas . She is very attractive : The word for very is muy , and it's spelled m-u-y.  \\nThe y you can imagine it like a n i. Muy .  \\nS: Muy .  \\nT: Good. So she is very attractive :  \\nS: Es muy atractivo - oh, atractiva .  \\nT: Atractiva .  \\nS: Es muy atractiva .  \\nT: Good. Atractiva  is showing us that it refers to a female. So this would probably help us work out \\nwho we are talking about . But, maybe we would want to say, to clarify or to emphasize or to \\ncontrast. So how would you say that, using the word for she? She is very attractive :  \\nS: I always get confused on that, if it's el or if it's la or ella.T: So I want you to spend some time to think about it, and not guess. Think about which is which, \\nmake a decision.  \\nS: Her is la.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Ella es muy atractiva .  \\nT: Good. Ella es muy atractiva . How would you say, she is very creative ?  \\nS: Ella es muy creativa .  \\nT: But, she's a ggressive :  \\nS: Pero , es, is it “aggressiva”? I was thinking of the double g, does it stay?  \\nT: Well these random double letters that we don't need in English really, they just become single \\nletters in Spanish. So I think there's a double s there as well in English, well that would also become \\nsingular. The only double letters that cross over are the r's and the n's. Like connotación .  \\nS: Oh double n's.  \\nT: “Con -notación”. If you get a double f, double s, double g, these random double letters you get in \\nEnglish; they don't cross over into Spanish.  \\nHow would you say, they are aggressive,  talking about a masculine or mixed group?  \\nS: Son agresivos .  \\nT: Good. And what if you wanted to use the word for they?  \\nS: Ellos son agresivos .  \\nT: Good. How would you say , he is negative ?  \\nS: Es negativo .  \\nT: Good, and if you use the word for he?  \\nS: Él es negativo .  \\nT: Good. He is very negative :S: Es muy negativo .  \\nT: How would you say, It's intensive ?  \\nS: Es intensivo .  \\nT: Good. So we use the neuter there, we don't  know what we're talking about. So we can just use the \\nmasculine singular, which is also like neuter. Es intensivo . How would you say, they are natives ?  \\nS: Son nativos .  \\nT: Good. Son nativos . And what if it was a female group?  \\nS: Son nativas .  \\nT: Very good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 29  \\nT: So I want to talk about something now that's different in Spanish. And first I want to speak about \\nwhat this means; rather than an obstacle to learning, it's part of the experience of learning a new \\nlanguage which can make you realize t hat in your own language you are both permitted and obliged \\nto perceive and express the world in a certain way. There's two important , kind of contradictory \\nconcepts here almost. It permits you and obliges you, it allows you and requires you, to perceive \\nand to express the world in a certain way. So, in Spanish we have two verbs for to be . So remember \\nto be  is is, am, are ; we get all of this from to be . We don't say I be; we say I am. So we have ser. \\nThis is where es comes from; this is where son comes fro m. And ser is about characteristics. When \\nwe refer to the characteristics of something. Actually un ser  is a being . We said that some form of \\nthe verb is often the noun; here it's the complete form. Un ser  is a being . Un ser humano is what?  \\nS: A human bei ng.  \\nT: A human being . And we could have found humano , even though there's no rule to find humano , \\nthat word, we have humanity . The words with -ity end how in Spanish?  \\nS: Humanidad .  \\nT: Humanidad . And then we can probably guess then that human  is humano. Un ser humano is a \\nhuman being . So ser refers to things that are characteristic of something. Then estar , which is the \\nother to be , estar,  refers to states - states we are in. The word state  is related to estar . So Spanish \\npermits us, allows us, but also o bliges us, when we are perceiving and expressing the world around \\nus, to make a decision  and to think about something. Is this a state, or is it a characteristic? So this \\nkind of sounds very abstract right now, so let's look at some examples. To be ti red: do you think \\nthis is a state? Or do you think it's a characteristic of you, to be tired? Is it a state you're in, or is it \\na characteristic of you?  \\nS: It's a state.  \\nT: Good. Where you are: is it a state you are in or is it a characteristic of y ou? Where you are.  \\nS: A state.  \\nT: A state. To be a good or a bad person: do you think this is a characteristic of you or a state?S: Characteristic.  \\nT: Characteristic. So it's very very important to kind of snub out now any temptation that you might  \\nhave to simplify this to temporary and permanent. This is what most learners do, and actually what \\nmany teachers do: simplify this concept to temporary and permanent. Which, if you think about it \\nthis way, will work most of the time, but not all of the ti me. We want to think in this way, is it a \\nstate or is it a  characteristic? For example if I say I am a student , it's not very permanent is it? But \\nis it a  state or a characteristic? My profession or my occupation.  \\nS: It should be a  state you're in.  \\nT: It's temporary but that doesn't make it a state. Your profession, according to Spanish, is \\ncharacteristic of you. Even if you do it for five minutes.  \\nS: I guess it's the same, for example, as you said before with the word aggressive . Someone can be \\naggre ssive and they can change, so that stops it from being permanent. But it's still a characteristic.  \\nT: Exactly. And we will see actually some adjectives we can use with both ser and estar  to give \\ndifferent meanings. But the great bulk of them go with one o r the other. This is Spanish \\nconceptually deciding whether it's a characteristic or a state; forcing us to make this differentiation  \\nand to express it. Let's look at the forms, lets look at the forms of estar  to begin. Now I am from \\nestar  is estoy. Estoy.  So it ends -oy. We already saw another verb that ends -oy which is voy: I go \\nor I'm going . Estoy .  \\nS: Estoy .  \\nT: Estoy . Now to be  is a very irregular verb in most languages. Look at English: from to be  we get \\nam, is, are, was . But this is actually not so irregular. We have this little irregularity -oy, estoy .  \\nS: Estoy .  \\nT: And the other irregularity that we have is that this verb is the only verb in the entire Spanish \\nlanguage that doesn't have the accent on the penultimate syllable in the present  tense. So it's not \\n“éstoy” it's estoy ; the accent is on the ending. This hasn't happened until now, and it won't happen \\nagain. So we have estar  and from estar  we have estoy . Now, all of the other forms are regular. \\nWe build them how we would expect to, wi th the exception that the accent will be on the lastsyllable. And it's the only verb in the entire present tense that has this characteristic. So how would \\nyou say he is / she is / it is / you are , from estar , using estar ?  \\nS: Está .  \\nT: Está . They  or for  you guys :  \\nS: Están .  \\nT: Good. And make it for you (informal ):  \\nS: Estás .  \\nT: Good. And for the “ we” version, the accent is where it should be because we're adding two \\nsyllables. So give me the “ we” version.  \\nS: Estamos .  \\nT: Estamos . So that's it, that's your set. Estoy, está, están, estás, estamos . The word for tired  is \\ncansado, cansado.   \\nS: Cansado .  \\nT: C-a-n-s-a-d-o. Cansado .  \\nS: Cansado .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say, I am tired ? This is a state.  \\nS: Estoy cansada .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Estoy cansada .  \\nT: Estoy cansada . Good. We are tired , talking about a mixed or a masculine group?  \\nS: Estamos cansados .  \\nT: Good. Estamos cansados . What if you are an all female group?  \\nS: Estamos cansadas .T: Good. Now the word for always  we said was siempre . Siempre . Now if you say, I'm always tired , \\nbecause tired  as an adjective, as an idea, is a state, not a characteristic, because we are looking at \\nthat whether it's a state or a characteristic, rather than is it permanent or is it temporary, we're using \\nestar . So even if you say I'm always tired  it doesn't matter, you still use estar . So siempre  is very \\nflexible in this sentence, you can put it anywhere. The emphasis is going to change when you move \\nit, but it's legal anywhere. So how would you say, I'm always ti red?  \\nS: Estoy cansada siempre .  \\nT: Good. Estoy cansada siempre . Estoy siempre cansada . Siempre estoy cansada . Or I would say \\ncansado . Good. So we want to resist the temptation to simplify this concept to “temporary” and \\n“permanent”. We want to ask ourse lf “is it a state, or is it a characteristic ?” To be tired : is it a state \\nor is it a characteristic? If we simplify it to temporary and permanent , most of the time it's going \\nto work, this simplification. But many times we're going to feel frustrated, f eeling like there's \\nsomething we don't understand because Spanish disagrees with us. If we have the concepts of \\ncharacteristic and state, the few times Spanish disagrees with what we consider a characteristic  \\nand state it's going to be an interesting poin t of perspective. For example, muerto .  \\nWhich means:  \\nS: Dead .  \\nT: Dead . Good. We looked at this briefly before as a part of mortgage , meaning death -pact. Muerto , \\nin Spanish, is a state. Death is a state. So if you want to say I'm dead , you would use estar . So how \\nwould you say that?  \\nS: Estoy muerta .  \\nT: Good. Estoy muerta . And I would say estoy muerto . And you can use it to say, I'm very tired  as \\nwell. Estoy muerta , estoy muerto . I'm very tired.  Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 30  \\nT: The word for how in Spanish is cómo .  \\nS: Cómo .  \\nT: Cómo . How do you think you would say, how are you ?, talking informally?  \\nS: ¿Cómo estás ?  \\nT: ¿Cómo estás ? Because when you ask somebody how they are, you're referring to their state. \\n¿Cómo estás ? And formally, how would you ask?  \\nS: ¿Cómo está?  \\nT: Good. And if you're asking more than one person?  \\nS: ¿Cómo están ?  \\nT: Very nice. The word for where  is dónde . So how would you say, where are you ?, talking \\ninformally?  \\nS: ¿Dónde estás ?  \\nT: ¿Dónde estás ? I don't know where we are.  So what  was I don't know ?  \\nS: No sé ?  \\nT: No sé . Good. I don't know where we are :  \\nS: So no sé donde estamos.   \\nT: Good. No sé donde estamos . Good. How would you say, I am here ?  \\nS: Estoy aquí .  \\nT: Estoy aquí, Estoy acá . How would you say, I want to be here ?  \\nS: Quiero estar aquí .  \\nT: Good. Quiero estar aquí . Good. How would you say, I'm going to be here later ? What was the \\nword for late?S: Tarde .  \\nT: Tarde . Good. And later  or more late ?  \\nS: Más tarde .  \\nT: Good. So I'm going to be here later :  \\nS: Voy a estar aquí más tarde .  \\nT: Good. Voy a estar aquí más tarde . Voy is I go or I'm going . How do you say you go or you are \\ngoing , speaking informally ?  \\nS: Vas.  \\nT: Vas. Good. So how would you say, where are you going to be ? So break it up: where are you \\ngoing to be ?:  \\nS: ¿Dónde vas a estar ?  \\nT: Yes. ¿ Dónde vas a estar ? Where are you going to be ? Good. So let's run through the forms again, \\nand let's use the words for emphasis just to practice them. So I am is:  \\nS: Yo estoy .  \\nT: Good. Yo estoy . He is :  \\nS: Él es tá.  \\nT: Good. Él está . She is :  \\nS: Ella está .  \\nT: Good. And you (talking formally) are:  \\nS: Usted está .  \\nT: Usted está . Good. They are , using the word for they:  \\nS: Ellos están .  \\nT: Ellos están . Or for feminine:S: Ellas están .  \\nT: Good. What is we are ?  \\nS: Nosotros estamos .  \\nT: Good. And for feminine:  \\nS: Nosotros, nosotras estamos .  \\nT: Good. So nosotros  changes to nosotras . You are , talking informally:  \\nS: Estás .  \\nT: Good. And if we used the word for you:  \\nS: Tú estás .  \\nT: Good. Tú estás . Tú estás . Good. How would you ask more than one person, where do you have \\nto be later?  So the first bit is where .  \\nS: Dónde .  \\nT: Do you have ?, and we are talking to you (plural), which is the same as they. Do you have ? Yeah, \\nwhat's to have ?  \\nS: Tener .  \\nT: Tener . Good. And we have it as -tain in words like maintain -mantener , contain -contener , \\nsustain -sostener , entertain -entretener,  obtain -obtener . That will help us. So first we want to \\nbuild you guys have  from tener .  \\nS: Tienen .  \\nT: Good. So where do yo u have to be later , to you (plural). Try it.  \\nS: Dónde tienen están .  \\nT: Slower.  \\nS: Oh sorry, to be , it's in the, yes. Dónde , and I’ve forgotten the other one now.  \\nT: It's okay, work it out again.S: Dónde tienen estar .  \\nT: There is something we need to  add to tienen  to get this meaning of have to, and i t's not a \\ncomfortable translation.  \\nS: Dónde tienen que estar .  \\nT: Later :  \\nS: Más tarde .  \\nT: ¿Dónde tienen que estar más tarde ? Good. You might want to say, he must be here,  and you can \\nuse this in the same way as you do in English, to refer to probability. Oh, he must be here by now , \\nor something like this. You have the same use in Spanish. And must  is the same as to owe , which \\nis related to debt. So what was to owe ?  \\nS: Deber .  \\nT: Deber . Good. So he owes or he must :  \\nS: Debe .  \\nT: Debe . This e doesn't split. Good. Debe . So he must be here :  \\nS: Debe estar aquí .  \\nT: Good. And he must be tired :  \\nS: Debe estar cansado .  \\nT: Good. Debe estar cansado . They must be tired :  \\nS: Deben estar cansados .  \\nT: Very  good. What if they were females?  \\nS: Cansadas .  \\nT: All together. Don't miss the fun.  \\nS: Deben estar cansadas .  \\nT: Good. Deben estar cansadas . To remain  was quedar . Quedar .S: Quedar .  \\nT: And to get the meaning of I stay , we say, I remain myself . So h ow would that sound? I remain \\nmyself:   \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: Me quedo . I am staying.  How would we are staying , or we remain ourselves,  be?  \\nS: Nos quedamos .  \\nT: Good. We are not going to stay, because we are very tired.  We are not going to stay, because we \\nare very tired. So the first bit that needs to command all of our attention is we are not going:   \\nS: No vamos .  \\nT: No vamos . We are not going to stay , so we are not going to remain ourselves:   \\nS: No vamos a quedarnos .  \\nT: Good. No vamos a quedarnos  or no nos v amos a quedar . You can have this as well. No nos \\nvamos a quedar . Because , same as why:  \\nS: Porque .  \\nT: Porque . We are very tired . And let's be a masculine or a mixed group. We are very tired :  \\nS: Estamos muy cansados .  \\nT: Good, now all together and not fro m memory. Thinking about it again, block by block. If you rush \\nit, you will trip and tripping is very time -consuming. So, we are not going to remain ourselves. To \\nstay:  \\nS: No vamos a quedarnos .  \\nT: Good. Because we are very tired .  \\nS: Porque estamos muy c ansados .  \\nT: Well done. No vamos a quedarnos, no nos vamos a quedar  porque , estamos muy cansados .  \\nVery good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 31  \\nT: We spoke about how we have two verbs for to be  in Spanish, estar  and ser. And we practiced with \\nestar , which is the verb that we use for states. And we said that the word state is related to estar.  \\nActually, it\\'s like the same word. What looks most different there between state  and estar  is that \\n/eh/ that you get at the beginning of estar . But you will find this actually with words that  start st-, \\nsp-, s- and consonant. You can\\'t begin a word like this in Spanish, where you can in English. So, \\nactually, you will find many words between English and Spanish that get like an extra e at the \\nbeginning in Spanish. For example, the word Spanis h in Spanish is Español . Or Spain , which is \\nEspaña . Student  - estudiante . School  - escuela . There you have the o splitting of school  to ue. \\nEscuela . Special  - especial . Spatial:   \\nS: Espacial .  \\nT: Good. Espacial . Strict : how do you think you might say strict, if it\\'s the same word in English and \\nSpanish?  \\nS: Estricto .  \\nT: Estricto . Good. Spectacular . It\\'s the same word as well.  \\nS: Espectacular .  \\nT: Good. Espectacular . So this is the difference that we see between state  and estar . So we said that \\nestar  we u se with what we will consider states of being. Now with what we consider characteristics \\nof being, we will use ser. And we said that ser, all by itself, means being . Un ser  is a being . Un \\nser humano  is a human being . Here, humano  is acting like an adjectiv e, so it\\'s coming afterwards. \\nBut it could also be a noun. We can say the human . How would that be? The human:   \\nS: El humano .  \\nT: El humano . And there it\\'s a noun. But el ser humano , there it\\'s an adjective. So I am, from ser, is \\nsoy. Soy.  \\nS: Soy.T: So like estoy  from estar , it ends o-y. There are just four verbs in the whole spanish language that \\nuse oy instead of o, for I. Voy, doy from dar, to give , doy, I am giving , and then estoy  and soy.  \\nSo we said that student  is estudiante . So if you wanted to s ay I am a student:   \\nS: Soy estudiante .  \\nT: Good. Soy estudiante . It is or she is , he is, you are , to usted . We learned it already, but we didn\\'t \\nlearn that it was from ser. How would you say It is possible ?  \\nS: Es posible .  \\nT: Es posible . Good. So we have es. Es is from ser. Now, ser is more irregular than estar . Doesn\\'t \\nlook like es is from ser, not too much. And then we had they are , or you guys are . What was that?  \\nS: Son.  \\nT: Son. Good. So, we\\'ve got three of the versions now. Soy, son, and es. We can take son and we can \\nwork out the \"we\" form  from son, working backwards. Now we said that working backwards \\nmeans taking off the consonant that you know associates to they, then bumping on the ending that \\nassociates to we, for example. So, to go from son, they are , to we are . How do you think it will \\nsound?  \\nS: Somos .  \\nT: Somos . Good. Which leaves one left, which is the you (informal ). Which is eres. Eres . E-r-e-s.  \\nS: Eres .  \\nT: Eres . So let\\'s make a recap. To be :  \\nS: Ser.  \\nT: I am:  \\nS: Soy.  \\nT: Soy. And if you want to use the word for I:  \\nS: Yo soy .T: Yo soy . He is :  \\nS: Es.  \\nT: Good. And if you want to use the word for he:  \\nS: Él es .  \\nT: Good. And she is :  \\nS: Ella es .  \\nT: They are :  \\nS: Son.  \\nT: Son, and what if you wanted to use the word for they? A nice way to remember they as well, is \\nyou can make she plural and you will get the feminine they.  \\nS: Ellas .  \\nT: So they are:   \\nS: Ellos son .  \\nT: Good. Ellos son, ellas son . Good. You guys are.  What is you (formal )?  \\nS: Usted .  \\nT: Good, and you guys  is the plural of that:  \\nS: Ustedes .  \\nT: Ustedes . So it\\'s the plural of usted , but it\\'s not necessarily formal. Ustedes . Only in some parts of \\nSpain, which we will talk about later. But everywhere else in the Spanish speaking world, this is \\njust how you refer to you guys . It doesn\\'t sound formal any more when it becomes plural. So how \\nwould you say you guys are ?  \\nS: Ustedes son .  \\nT: Ustedes son . Good. Then we have we are :  \\nS: Nosotros somos .T: Good. Somos  or nosotros somos , or if we were an all female group ?  \\nS: Nosotras somos .  \\nT: Nosotras somos . Good. And then we have the you (informal ), which is eres, which is probably \\nthe weirdest form out of these ones. We can relate it to es maybe, they are similar, es, eres. So how \\nwould you say you are , using the wor d for you?  \\nS: Tú eres .  \\nT: Tú eres . Good. What was the word for how?  \\nS: Cómo .  \\nT: Cómo . Now if I want to say How is he? , How is he doing?  I will use estar . So how would I say, \\nusing estar , how is he, how is he doing?:   \\nS: ¿Cómo está ?  \\nT: ¿Cómo está ? Good. Now if I want to ask you, what is he like?  Maybe you tell me about your new \\nboss or a new friend, and I ask you, what is he like , or what is she like? Am I referring to their state \\nor to their characteristic?  \\nS: Characteristic .  \\nT: So how would I ask How is he, what is he like? How is she, what is she like?:   \\nS: ¿Cómo es ?  \\nT: ¿Cómo es ? Good.',\n",
       " \"Track 32  \\nT: The word for boring  or bored  is aburrido . Aburrido .  \\nS: Aburrido .  \\nT: A-b-u-r-r-i-d-o. Aburrido .  \\nS: Aburrido .  \\nT: Now this is boring  or bored . One o f these words in English is a characteristic and the other one is \\na state. Which is which? Boring , if I say you are boring , is it a state or a characteristic?  \\nS: Characteristic.  \\nT: And if I say you are bored , is it a state or a characteristic?  \\nS: A stat e.  \\nT: A state. So in English we have two different words to express this difference whereas in Spanish \\nyou will just decide whether you are going to use ser or estar . So, you will have to think about it. \\nHow will you say, it is boring ?  \\nS: Es aburrido .  \\nT: Es aburrido . Good. He is bored , is it a characteristic or a state?  \\nS: A state.  \\nT: Good. So, he is bored :  \\nS: Está aburrido .  \\nT: Está aburrido . But he is boring :  \\nS: Es aburrido .  \\nT: Good. And she is boring :  \\nS: Es aburrido . Oh sorry, ella es aburrido .  \\nT: Spanish is more subtle than that.S: Es aburrida .  \\nT: Es aburrida . They are boring :  \\nS: Son aburridos .  \\nT: Son aburridos . They are bored :  \\nS: Están aburridos .  \\nT: Good. Están aburridos . So with some adjectives we get a different meaning depending on  whether \\nwe use ser or estar . The word for from  in Spanish is de. From  or of, de. De.  \\nS: De.  \\nT: We get this forming part of many Latin -English words, for example, deliver . The de- of deliver  is \\nactually from . -liver is to do with freedom, like liberat ion, liberación . How would you say to \\nliberate ?  \\nS: Liberar .  \\nT: Good. Libre  is free in Spanish. So again we see this grey area between v and b, between English \\nand Spanish, between libre  and -liver in deliver  just as we did between savvy  and saber  for \\nexample, so deliver  is like from  or of freeing , which has much more sense if you look at the original \\nmeanings of deliver , like to deliver a baby , deliver me from evil , rather than to deliver a package , \\nwhich is a much more modern meaning. You can see much more the ideology in the vocabulary \\nwith the older uses. Another interesting word that we can see this de in, in English, is decipher  for \\nexample. Decipher  is actually a combination of Arabic and Latin. You have de meaning of or from , \\nand “cipher” from “s ifr” which means zero in Arabic. So to decipher  is to go from zero , or \\nsomething like this. So anyway we have de for from  or of. Now, if I want to ask, where is he from?  \\nIs it a characteristic or a state, where you are from ?  \\nS: A characteristic.  \\nT: Yes , it's not where you are, it's where you are from, this is characteristic of you. So in Spanish we \\nare going to say, from where are you, from where is he, from where is she ? This is the word order.  \\nSo, from where  is what?S: De dónde .  \\nT: De dónde . From where is he? From where are you (formal) ? et cetera?  \\nS: ¿De dónde es ?  \\nT: ¿De dónde es ? And you informal . You remember how was you are , you informal. It's kind of \\nsimilar to es:  \\nS: ¿De dónde eres ?  \\nT: ¿De dónde eres ? So this sentence actually wil l help you remember this kind of irregular form eres \\nbecause you will hear it all the time. ¿De dónde eres ? From where are you, where are you from ? \\nHow would you say, where are they from? :  \\nS: ¿De dónde son ?  \\nT: ¿De dónde son ? But if you want to a sk, where are they?  Their location, where are they ? How \\nwould you ask?  \\nS: ¿Dónde están ?  \\nT: Good, ¿ Donde están ? Because now we refer to a state. Good. So, we have this adjective as well, \\nlibre , like in deliver  and liberation , libre , which means free. Again, we might mean a state or we \\nmight mean a characteristic. Now sometimes, to show the difference, we might not just use ser \\nand estar , we might actually also change the way we say it. So for example, if you want to say I \\nam free , and you mean from your exams, from work, do you think you mean a state or a \\ncharacteristic?  \\nS: A state.  \\nT: A state. So how would you say that, I am free ?  \\nS: Estoy libre .  \\nT: Good. Estoy libre . And libre  does not change for masculine and feminine because it ends e. Only \\nadjec tives ending o will change. Estoy libre . Good. Now if you mean as a characteristic, as a \\ncharacteristic of your personality, you are a free person , then you might say:  \\nS: Soy libre .T: Soy libre . You might also say, I am a free person . So person  is perso na, and you could say, I am \\na - what's a person ?  \\nS: Una persona .  \\nT: Good. I am a free person :  \\nS: Soy una persona libre .  \\nT: Good. Soy una persona libre . Persona  is feminine, not because of you, because the word is \\nfeminine. So I, as a male, would also s ay, soy una persona libre . So it's the noun in itself, persona , \\nthat is feminine. So in this case, with libre , there's no problem to move between ser and estar . \\nYou can use libre  with ser or with estar  to give slightly different meanings. So some adjective s \\nyou will be able to move between ser and estar  and others you won't. If you want to get around \\nthat uncertainty, instead of trying out soy libre you could just say soy una persona libre , and then \\nbecause persona  is going with soy, because what you are sa ying in fact is, I am a person , soy una \\npersona , then you know you are safe. Also, different Spanish dialects can have different ideas \\nabout what should go with ser and what should go with estar . So for example, casado , which \\nmeans married , not cansado , casado , comes from casa, which literally means housed . When you \\nare married  you are housed . Casado , in some places they use with ser and in some places they use \\nwith estar . They can't agree on whether being married is a characteristic or a st ate. If you want to \\navoid this insecurity about it you can say, soy una persona casada , and then you know that \\npersona  is going with soy, so whatever then describes persona  is not important. Persona  goes \\nwith soy. When you say I am a person , then that is c haracteristic. Let's explore this idea a little \\nmore. Busy  in Spanish is occupied , ocupado . Ocupado .  \\nS: Ocupado .  \\nT: Good. How do you say, I am busy ?  \\nS: Estoy ocupada .  \\nT: Estoy ocupada . Or I would say, estoy ocupado . Now, if I want to say, I am a busy  person , then \\nwith this adjective, actually, I can't switch to soy, and say soy ocupado . That's bad Spanish. But \\nyou as a Spanish learner, how are you supposed to know that? So, you can use persona  as a safetynet, in the sense of I am a busy person , and t hen you're sure it's perfect Spanish. So how would \\nyou say I am a busy person ?  \\nS: Soy una persona ocupada .  \\nT: Good. Soy una persona ocupada . So that's a characteristic, because what you are actually saying \\nis, I am a person , and much more characteristi c than that you can't get. So, estoy ocupado , as a \\nstate, and then soy una persona ocupada , characteristic, males or females  would say persona \\nocupada . Ocupada  refers to persona , not to the speaker, so I would also say, soy una persona \\nocupada . How would you say, we are busy ?  \\nS: Estamos ocupados .  \\nT: Estamos ocupados . But if you wanted to say, we are busy people :  \\nS: Somos personas ocupadas .  \\nT: Good. Somos personas ocupadas . To be worried  is to be preoccupied . So how do you think that \\nwould sound?  \\nS: Preocupado .  \\nT: Preocupado . I am worried :  \\nS: Estoy preocupada .  \\nT: Good. He is worried :  \\nS: Está preocupado .  \\nT: Good. He is a worried person . He is worried as a characteristic. He is worryful :  \\nS: Es una persona preocupada .  \\nT: Good. Es una persona  preocupada .\",\n",
       " \"Track 33  \\nT: So some adjectives will exclusively go with estar . Some adjectives will exclusively go with ser. \\nSome adjectives can go with either ser or estar , and change their meaning, like aburrido , meaning \\nbored  as a state, or boring  as a characteristic, just changing depending on whether it goes with ser \\nor estar . Another example of a word like this is listo. Listo .  \\nS: Listo .  \\nT: Now listo, when it comes with estar , means ready . So how would you say I am ready ?  \\nS: Estoy listo , or lista, in my case.  \\nT: Estoy lista , or listo. How would you say, we are ready ?  \\nS: Estamos listos .  \\nT: Good. And what if we were a female group?  \\nS: Estamos listas .  \\nT: Estamos listas . And what if we wanted to emphasize We are ready :  \\nS: Somos , no,  \\nT: You m ake it a characteristic and it's more emphatic...  \\nS: Nosotros -  \\nT: It's a very interesting idea .  \\nS: It's what you said when I go too fast. So it's nosotros estamos listas .  \\nT: There's a contradiction there.  \\nS: Nosotras estamos listas .  \\nT: Yes. All-female group: nosotras estamos listas , or male or mixed group: nosotros estamos listos . \\nSo, to be listo, to be ready as a characteristic, means to be smart  in Spanish. So this is one of the \\nwords that we can use with ser or estar  and the meaning changes. So, estoy listo : I am ready . Soy \\nlisto: I am smart . So if you want to say, he is smart,  he is smart,  how would you say it?S: Es listo .  \\nT: Es listo . She is smart :  \\nS: Es lista .  \\nT: Good. You are smart , speaking informally, to a woman? If you forgot th e you are you can think of \\nwhere are you from ? That might help you trigger it. De dónde -  \\nS: Eres. Eres lista .  \\nT: Good. You are very smart:   \\nS: Eres muy lista .  \\nT: Good. The word for so, like I am so bored or I am so tired , is tan. T-a-n. Tan.  \\nS: Tan.  \\nT: So how would you say, I am so tired ?  \\nS: Estoy tan cansado. Cansada .  \\nT: Good. Estoy tan cansado . Estoy tan cansada . Good. How would you say, I am so bored ?  \\nS: Estoy tan aburrida .  \\nT: Good. Estoy tan aburrido , aburrida . How would you say, he is so bored ?  \\nS: Él está tan aburrido .  \\nT: Good. Está tan aburrido , or Él está tan aburrido . Now how would you say, it is so boring,  it is \\nso boring. So boring , not bored. Boring .  \\nS: Es tan aburrido .  \\nT: Good. Es tan aburrido . The word for good  in Span ish is bueno . We've mentioned this before. We \\nhave in English Bon Appetit which is of course French, but we say it in English, and you can see \\nthe o of bon appetit splitting to become bueno  in Spanish. Now the meaning of bueno  changes as \\nwell between ser and estar . If you are talking about it is, the change is a kind of change in feeling. \\nEs bueno, está bueno : a small change in feeling which really depends on dialect so we won't lookat it too much here, we'll just listen. But if you refer to people, in mos t dialects, if we use ser, we \\nget the meaning of “to be a good person” or “to be good at something”. So if you want to say, they \\nare good , and you mean “they are good people”, or that they are good at something, how would \\nyou say it?  \\nS: Son buenos .  \\nT: Son buenos . He is good :  \\nS: Es bueno .  \\nT: Es bueno . Now if you use estar , it will sound like he is attractive. He is in good form . So bueno \\nwith estar , if we are talking about people, then gives you this meaning. So how would you say \\nthat? He is good, meanin g attractive, in good form :  \\nS: Está bueno .  \\nT: Está bueno . So, you see that you can have many different changes in shade of meaning between \\nser and estar . So other than the fact that we are being permitted and obliged to perceive and express \\nthe world in a certain way by Spanish, which is very interesting in itself, we also get the opportunity \\nto use these different nuances between ser and estar  and when you really get your head around it, \\nwhich is just through listening and observing and seeing how people  are using it, you will probably \\nfeel that it's missing in English. That sometimes in English you might want to clarify, not estar  \\nbut es, and you can't do it. So you realize that Spanish gives you a tool to relate to reality that in \\nthis case, English doe sn't give you. And this is one of the most fascinating and exciting things \\nabout language learning. Not an obstacle to speaking the language, we don't want to see it like this, \\noh every time I use to be I have to think about this “characteristic or state” business. No, we want \\nto look at it from the other angle, about what it offers us. How would you say, I want to know how \\nhe is,  and we mean, I want to know, how is he doing ?  \\nS: Quiero saber cómo es .  \\nT: How is he doing :  \\nS: Oh. Cómo está .T: Good. Quie ro saber cómo está . Now what would it mean, quiero saber  cómo es ? What would \\nthat mean?  \\nS: How he is. What he's like .  \\nT: Exactly. I want to know what he's like . Good. Another adjective you can use with ser or estar  is \\nfeliz. What do you think feliz migh t mean?  \\nS: Happy .  \\nT: And how do you know that?  \\nS: Feliz navidad .  \\nT: Oh okay! Happy Christmas . Feliz navidad.  But is there some connection in English that might \\nhave helped you as well? Did you hear felicity  in English?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: How would felicity  be in Spanish?  \\nS: Felicidad .  \\nT: Felicidad . Which means happiness . Happiness . So feliz, happy . So feliz can also go with ser or \\nestar  to give the meaning of I am happy or I am a happy person . So we don't need to say I am a \\nhappy person , we can just use ser. So like I said there's no real way for you to know that other \\nthan listening. If you wanted to play safe, and say, literally, I am a happy person , it would not be \\nat all incorrect. So, firstly, how do you say, I am happy , as a state?  \\nS: Estoy feliz .  \\nT: Estoy feliz . Now, I am happy , and you mean as a characteristic :  \\nS: Soy feliz .  \\nT: Soy feliz . So this is fine. You can do this, but there is no real way for you to know whether feliz is \\nan adjective that is flexible enough to be used with ser and estar . It really depends on the adjective \\nitself, the word itself, rather than the meaning in many cases. So, with that insecurity, and wanting \\nto give the meaning, you could have just said, I am a happy person , and then you don't have to \\nworry about it. So how would you say that?S: Soy una persona feliz .  \\nT: Good. Soy una persona feliz . And that's also perfect Spanish. So there you could have said soy \\nfeliz or soy una persona feliz . So to really get our heads around ser and estar  it's important to \\nlisten activ ely, and to notice and see how people are using ser and estar , and making our own \\nconclusions as to why, working with this base of state and characteristic. It's a process of listening, \\nand the more you get intimate with this idea, it offers you a great ra nge of expression that you don't \\nhave in English and you should really enjoy it.\",\n",
       " \"Track 34  \\nT: To speak . Do you remember how to say to speak ? It begins with the silent h.  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar . Good. What is I speak  or I am speaking ?  \\nS: Hablo .  \\nT: Hablo . Good. And what was to sleep , or to be dormant  let’s say ?  \\nS: Dormir .  \\nT: Dormir . And how do you say I sleep ?  \\nS: Duermo .  \\nT: Good. We said also that you can get the additional meaning of I fall asleep  by saying I sleep myself:   \\nS: Me duermo.   \\nT: Me duermo . Good. To eat  was:  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . Good. So I eat or I am eating is :  \\nS: Como .  \\nT: Como . So here the o doesn’t split. Good. To have breakfast, to have breakfast , we don’t say in \\nSpanish to have  breakfast . We have a verb to breakfast,  let’s say, and the verb to breakfast  is \\ndesayunar, desayunar .  \\nS: Desayunar .  \\nT: Breakfast  and desayunar  are direct translations of each other in fact. I don’t know if you noticed \\nthat in English breakfast  is “break fast”. When we have breakfast we break the fa st. And in Spanish \\n“des” is like un, ayunar  is to fast . So to “un -fast”. So desayunar  is like to “un -fast”, to “break \\nfast”. Desayunar .  \\nS: Desayunar .T: To have breakfast. I'm having breakfast  or I have breakfast:   \\nS: Desayuno .  \\nT: Desayuno . And desayuno  is also the noun. El desayuno  is the breakfast . What was to wait  or to \\nhope ? Desperate  is related because again we have this “des” like in desayunar  which is like “un-\\nhoped ” or “un -hopeful”  is to be desperate . So to wait  or to hope :  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: Good . Esperar . Good. What is I wait  or I am waiting  or I hope  or I am hoping ?  \\nS: Espero .  \\nT: Espero . So we’ve been giving the verbs two translations in the present tense. I speak or I am \\nspeaking , I go or I am going , I wait or I am waiting . This is because this –ing tense in English we \\nreally overuse it. For example we use this –ing in English to refer to the future: He is doing it \\ntomorrow , whereas in Spanish we just use the present tense with that future context. Lo hace \\nmañana . Which is why we need to giv e both translations for hace , for example. He makes or does  \\nor he is making or doing . And we translate hablo  as I speak  and I am speaking . But this doesn’t \\nmean that I am speaking  doesn’t exist. It does exist but we use it in Spanish only when we want to \\nshow what we are doing right now in this moment. So, beginning this structure I am speaking , this \\nI am: do you think that you would choose ser for characteristics, or do you think that you would \\nchoose estar  for states?  \\nS: It’s a state so estoy .  \\nT: Go od. We will use estar  because of course what we are doing is a state. So we will always use \\nestar  with these structures. So the first part of this sentence is estoy . Now to get speaking,  –ing, \\nfrom to speak  we take off –r and we add –ando , -ando . And we g et hablando .  \\nS: Hablando .  \\nT: So, I’m speaking :  \\nS: Estoy hablando .T: Estoy hablando . Good. So maybe somebody interrupts you and you won’t say hablo , you will \\nsay estoy hab lando . How would you say I am waiting  and you mean right now? Right now, I am \\nwaiting here, I am waiting here :  \\nS: Estoy esperando aquí.  \\nT: Estoy esperando aquí. Good. So you could say espero aquí . Maybe it would sound a little more \\nlike I'll wait here  rather than I am waiting here  but both are fine. In many situations both ar e fine \\nand there will be just a slight change in meaning. Espero aquí , estoy esperando aquí . What you \\ncan’t do is say I am eating  with her  tomorrow . The –ing, you need to use it just for what you are \\ndoing right now. So how was to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: And how would you say I speak  or I am speaking ?  \\nS: Hablo .  \\nT: Hablo . And what was to prepare ? If you forgot  it you can go from preparation .  \\nS: Preparación,  Preparar .  \\nT: And I prepare  or I am preparing :  \\nS: Preparo .  \\nT: Good. So how wou ld you say I am preparing it tomorrow ?  \\nS: Lo preparo mañana .  \\nT: Lo preparo mañana . So if you want to show, if you want to emphasize that we are doing \\nsomething right now, I am preparing , firstly if we divide that up into two bits : I am - preparing :  \\nS: Estoy.   \\nT: Estoy . Good. Preparar  becomes?  \\nS: Preparando .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I am preparing ?S: Estoy preparando .  \\nT: Good. Estoy preparando . Good. So that’s if you want to say I am preparing it right now , you can \\nuse this structure. So how would you say I am preparing it ?  \\nS: Lo estoy preparando .  \\nT: Lo estoy preparando  or Estoy prepar ándolo . Even though it’s a changed verb here we can have \\nthe lo after –ando . Estoy prepar ándolo or lo estoy preparando . We said that to hav e breakfast  \\nwas desayunar , desayunar . So how would you say we are having breakfast  and you mean right \\nnow?  \\nS: Estamos desayunando .  \\nT: -ando . Good. Estamos desayunando . So, for –ar verbs we take of f the –ar and we put –ando  and \\nwe get this tense to show  what we are doing right now. And we are not going to use it as we do in \\nEnglish: I'm finding out tomorrow  and I'm doing it next week , I'm preparing it later . How would \\nyou say I'm preparing it later ?  \\nS: Estoy preparando -  \\nT: This is not how we use it. So in Spanish we only use it to describe what we're doing right now.  \\nS: Right. Sorry.  \\nT: So this is why we are giving preparo , for example, the translation of both I prepare  and I am \\npreparing . So that when we want to say things like I am preparing i t later , we don’t go to estoy \\npreparando .  \\nS: Lo preparo más tarde .  \\nT: Lo preparo más tarde . Good. But if you wanted to give the meaning of I am preparing it right \\nnow,  how would you say it ?  \\nS: Estoy prepar ándolo .  \\nT: Good. Estoy prepar ándolo  or lo estoy preparando . And there you get the meaning of right now \\nin this moment . Good. So for –ar verbs we are taking off the –ar and we are putting –ando  to getthis –ing. For –er, –ir verbs we take off the –er or the –ir and we put on -iendo , -iendo , i-e-n-d-o, \\nto get this –ing form. So how would you get eating  from to eat ? How would eating  be from comer ?  \\nS: Comiendo .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I am eating , and you mean right now?  \\nS: Estoy comiendo .  \\nT: Estoy comiendo . Good. I am eating . And how would you say he is eating  or she is eating  or you \\nformal?  \\nS: Está comiendo .  \\nT: Good. Está comiendo . So maybe somebody calls you and they say Can I speak to Pablo? , and \\nyou say Está comiendo , you mean right now. What was to sell ? You can think of vending machine .  \\nS: Vender .  \\nT: Vender . Good. How would you say: They sell it, they sell it ?  \\nS: Venden . Lo venden .  \\nT: Lo venden . Good. How would you say they are selling it tomorrow  or they will sell it tomorrow ?  \\nS: Lo venden manaña .  \\nT: Lo venden mañana . Good. Now if you want to say they are selling it right now,  and you want to \\ngive that meaning “right now” how would it be?  \\nS: Están vendi éndolo .  \\nT: Good. Están vendi éndolo  or lo están vendiendo . Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 35  \\nT: So going back to ser and estar , and the difference between ser and estar , how would you say \\nsincerity  in Spanish? Sincerity:   \\nS: Is it sinceridad ?  \\nT: It is. Sinceridad . So if you had to guess, what is sincere  in Spanish, what would you gue ss?  \\nS: Sencero .  \\nT: Sincero .  \\nS: Sincero .  \\nT: Sincero . Good. So there's no rule for this, but if we have sincerity  becoming sinceridad , we can \\nguess that sincere  will be very similar in Spanish and we can play around and try to find it. Sincero . \\nGood. So do you think to be sincere  is a state or a characteristic?  \\nS: It can be both, depending on the situation.  \\nT: Indeed, but if you look at the concept, the concept of sincere  - because this is how Spanish decides \\nit - the concept of sincere , is it a state o r a characteristic to be sincere ?  \\nS: Well if it's, generally  it's a characteristic, but if someone, we're talking about that moment that \\nsomeone is saying something, then in that moment, they're being, they're in that state of being \\nsincere.  \\nT: You 're right, and our usage, and that's what we're going to look at now, can get around that, but \\nSpanish is not looking at the use. It's looking just at the concept by itself, so sincerity , is it a \\ncharacteristic or is it a state?  \\nS: It's a characteristic.  \\nT: Good. So, it goes with ser. So if you want to say, I am sincere , how would you say it?  \\nS: Soy sincero , sincera .  \\nT: Good. Soy sincera . Good. And we are sincere :S: Somos sinceras , if it's women.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Or sinceros .  \\nT: Good. But, as you correc tly said, you might want to say, I am being sincere now . So to give the \\nmeaning of I am being sincere , you will say, very literally, I am being sincere . How would you \\nsay that? I am being sincere :  \\nS: Estoy , I forgot the word for being .  \\nT: Ser is to be , in this case because it refers to sincero , so how would you make that -ing? Vender , \\nvendiendo . Ser:  \\nS: Estoy siendo sincero .  \\nT: Or in your case it would be?  \\nS: Sincera .  \\nT: Good. Estoy siendo sincera.  Or estoy siendo sincero .  \\nHonest  in Spanish is honesto . Honesto . So how would you say, we are being honest ?  \\nS: Estamos siendo honestos .  \\nT: Good. Estamos siendo honestos . So to be honest , as an idea, is characteristic. But this doesn't \\nrestrict us in Spanish of course, if you want to say we are being  honest , we can do that in exactly \\nthe same way as we do in English. We are : estamos , being : siendo , our characteristic to be : \\nhonestos . Estamos siendo honestos . Good! Salir  is to go out or to leave . Salir . To go out or to \\nleave , and it's irregular in th at the I version is not “salo” but, you remember how it was?  \\nS: Salgo .  \\nT: Salgo . Good. Salgo . I leave or I go out . Good. Soon , soon  in Spanish is pronto . So you can say, I \\nam leaving soon . Is soon  right now?  \\nS: No.  \\nT: No. So how would you say, I am lea ving soon ?S: Salgo pronto .  \\nT: Good. Salgo pronto . And how would you say, I am leaving tomorrow ?  \\nS: Salgo mañana .  \\nT: Good. Salgo mañana . But if you want to say, I am leaving right now , and you mean this moment?  \\nS: Estoy saliendo .  \\nT: Estoy saliend o. So we need to resist the temptation of the negative language transfer from English \\nwhich will make us want to put -ing in many places where we don't put it in Spanish, which is why \\nwe are giving usually in the present tense both translations: I wait, I am waiting; I sell, I am selling . \\nTo buy was comprar .  \\nS: Comprar .  \\nT: I buy them , or I'm buying them . How would that be?  \\nS: Los compro .  \\nT: Los compro . Good. I am buying them tomorrow :  \\nS: Los compro mañana .  \\nT: Good. I am buying them next week . Next w eek is the week that comes . La semana is the week .  \\nWhat is to come ?  \\nS: Venir .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say the week that comes ? La semana que :  \\nS: Viene .  \\nT: So I'm buying them next week, I'm buying them the week that comes:   \\nS: Los compro la seman a que viene .  \\nT: Good. Los compro la semana que viene . So again, here we would use -ing in English, I am buying \\nthem next week , but we want to resist that temptation in Spanish. Los compro la semana queviene . If you wanted to say right now : so maybe  you get a phone call and somebody asks you, \\nhave you bought them yet? And you say, I am buying them now , how would you say that?  \\nS: Estoy compr ándolos ahora .  \\nT: Good, good. I am buying them now . Los estoy comprando ahora, estoy compr ándolos ahora.\",\n",
       " \"Track 36  \\nT: So we saw that we can use the present tense to refer to the future. For example, if we have some \\nfuture context we can just use the present tense by itself. So we could say I am having breakfast \\nwith them tomorrow . Now in Spanish, you don’t say with them . You say with they . With they . So \\nhow would that be, first?  \\nS: Con ellos.  \\nT: Good. And to have breakfast , we said, was to “un -fast”. Desayunar , like in English breakfast , \\n“break fast”. So, I’m having breakfast with them tomorrow :  \\nS: Desayuno con ellos mañana .  \\nT: Good. Desayuno con ellos mañana . Good. And if we don’t have a future context, like mañana  \\nor any other context showing us it’s the future, we can also use I am going  to speak about the \\nfuture. So you can say I am going to have breakfast with them . How is that?  \\nS: Voy a desayunar con  ellos.  \\nT: Good. Voy a desayunar con ellos . Good. And if we have the future context, it doesn’t mean we \\nhave to say desayuno con ellos mañana . We could also say voy a desayunar con e llos mañana . \\nThe fact that we have future context doesn’t mean we can’t use voy anymore. So we’ve seen in \\nthat way we can use the present to talk about the future, but this doesn’t mean that we don’t have \\na future tense in Spanish. We do. Luckily, we don’t  have to learn any new sounds to master the \\nfuture tense in Spanish. The future tense in Spanish is connected with the past tense that we learned \\nof haber . Haber . This past of I have had breakfast  or I have eaten , I have gone . So let’s make a \\nrecap of the forms of haber . Now it’s very irregular, haber , and we said that a nice trick to \\nremember the different forms of haber  is just looking at the two vowel sounds inside the verb \\nhaber . So what are those two vowel sounds?  \\nS: /a/ and / e/.  \\nT: Good. Let’s start  with / e/. What does he mean by itself?  \\nS: I have .T: Good. I have  spelled h-e. And what other person is connected with I? What’s the plural of I, let’s \\nsay?  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Good. We. So we have he for I have  and hemos  for we have . What is ha by itself? H-a:  \\nS: He, she, it , or you (formal).  \\nT: Good. So give me the other two versions now.  \\nS: Han.  \\nT: Good. They  or you guys.  \\nS: And has, which is you (informal).  \\nT: Good. So that's our set. Let’s practice a little bit some structures with haber  just t o recap. So what \\nwas to sleep ? Dormant :  \\nS: Dormir .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I have slept ? Begin with I have :  \\nS: He dormido .  \\nT: Good. We have slept :  \\nS: Hemos dormido .  \\nT: He has slept :  \\nS: Ha dormido .  \\nT: Good. How would you say to rec ommend ?  \\nS: Recomendación . Recomendar .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say They have recommended it, they have recommended it , and I remind \\nyou that with these structures with haber , the it has to come before haber . There’s no option of \\nwhere to put it. So They have recommended it :  \\nS: Lo han recomendado .T: Lo han recomendado . Good. So these forms that we have, these forms of haber that we have – \\nhe, hemos, ha, has, han – are also the endings that we have for the future tense. So like I said, \\nwe will learn  the future tense now without having to learn any new sounds. Now, the interesting \\nthing about the future tense is that we take the verb in its “to” form, where it’s an –ar verb, -er \\nverb, or –ir verb, doesn’t matter, and we put the ending at the end of th e “to” form. And we \\nstress the ending. We are effectively pushing the accent into the future. For example, we have \\ncomer , and what was I have  from haber ?  \\nS: He.  \\nT: He. So that’s the sound, without the h, just the sound / e/. That’s the sound that we need for future \\nfor I. We add that on to comer  and we get comeré , and that’s I will eat . Now we are pushing the \\naccent into the future, which might just seem like a coincidence. But you can notice that it happens \\nin other languages as well, this phenomenon. For  example, in Greek part of the past tense is to pull \\nthe accent back one syllable, to pull the accent back into the past. And actually, this is so important \\nin Greek that if there is not a syllable there to do it, you add one to pull the accent back into t he \\npast. So this is a phenomenon that you see in different languages. The accents representing \\nsomehow or reflecting somehow the concept of time and tenses. So here we have pushing the \\naccent into the future: comeré . I will eat . You can give me the rest of  the versions for the future of \\ncomer .  \\nS: Comeremos .  \\nT: Good. Comeremos : We will eat.   \\nS: Comerá .  \\nT: Good. He will eat .  \\nS: Comerás .  \\nT: You (informal) will eat .  \\nS: Comerán .  \\nT: Good. They  or you guys will eat . Good. What was to go ? We said it was very irregular. We have \\nvoy and vamos  and va, but the verb to go  doesn’t look anything like them.S: Ir.  \\nT: Ir. Ir in the future is regular. So we can follow these rules and get the future tenses of to go: I will \\ngo, he will go.  So what is I will go ?  \\nS: Iré.  \\nT: Iré. And we will go :  \\nS: Iremos .  \\nT: Iremos . He will go :  \\nS: Irá.  \\nT: Irá. They  or you guys :  \\nS: Irán.  \\nT: Irán. Like the country. They will go to Iran :  \\nS: Irán a Irán .  \\nT: Irán a Irán . Good. You (informal) will go :  \\nS: Irás.  \\nT: Good. And what if we wanted to make it a question? Will you go? :  \\nS: ¿Irás?  \\nT: Good. Won’t you go? :  \\nS: ¿No irás ?  \\nT: Why won’t you go? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no irás ?  \\nT: Good. What was to find  or to encounter ?  \\nS: Encontrar .  \\nT: Encontrar . I will find :S: Encontraré .  \\nT: Good. Encontraré . I will find it :  \\nS: Lo encontraré .  \\nT: Good. Lo encontraré . We will find it :  \\nS: Los encontraré .  \\nT: That was an interesting error, because I said we, so I made I plural with we, and your mind made \\nthe it plural, ah?  \\nS: Yeah.  \\nT: We wil l find it :  \\nS: Lo encontraremos .  \\nT: Good. Lo encontraremos . He or she or you (formal) will find it :  \\nS: Lo encontrará .  \\nT: Good. Lo encontrará . He will find them , or she will find them , or you (formal) will find them :  \\nS: Los encontrarán .  \\nT: So you m ade both of them them  or they.  \\nS: You said them .  \\nT: But we said He will find them  or she will find them.   \\nS: Oh sorry! Los encontrará.   \\nT: Good. Los encontrará . So we want to think about the two things separately, ah? Who is doing the \\nverb and who are th ey doing it to. Who or what are they doing it to. We said that quedar  means \\nto remain, quedar , and to get the meaning of I stay  we say I remain myself . How was that? I \\nremain myself :  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: Me quedo . Good. How would you say I will stay , then? I will remain myself.S: Quedaré .  \\nT: Good, but quedaré  means I will remain  and if you want the meaning of stay, you must, must use - \\nS: Me.  \\nT: Yeah.  \\nS: Me quedaré .  \\nT: Me quedaré . I will remain myself  or I will stay . I will stay here :  \\nS: Me quedaré aquí .  \\nT: Good. What was to prepare ?  \\nS: Preparar .  \\nT: Good. And I will prepare :  \\nS: Prepararé .  \\nT: Good. So it’s very important to think out the whole verb, preparar , and then add on the -e, \\nprepararé . Because a very common mistake that learners make is to say  preparé . And they miss \\nout the last ar because they don’t think out the whole verb first. So we must think out the whole \\nverb first, preparar , and then add on the ending, prepararé . What was to wait  or to hope ?  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: Esperar . I will wait :  \\nS: Esperaré .  \\nT: Good. What was to organize ?  \\nS: Organizar .  \\nT: Good. He will organize :  \\nS: Organizará .  \\nT: Good. Organizará . So the useful thing about the accent being on this ending is that we don’t have \\nto worry about where the accent goes when we’re pron ouncing the whole verb, organizará .On the end. Organizará . They will organize :  \\nS: Organizarán .  \\nT: Good. Organizarán . Good. What was tired ?  \\nS: Cansado .  \\nT: Good. Cansado . So how would you say I will be tired ? I will be tired :  \\nS: Seré ? Ah. Estaré can sada .  \\nT: Good. Estaré cansada . Good.  How would it will be  be, from ser? It will be , using ser:  \\nS: Será .  \\nT: Good. Sound familiar from anywhere?  \\nS: Que será , será.  \\nT: Yes. So very simple, the future tense. Doesn’t matter if we have –ar, -er, or –ir verb. We are adding \\non these endings and these endings are the same as the different versions of haber . So if we forget \\nthem we can look back to haber  and then we just add that on the end. But, in saying that, the future \\ntense is not so often used in Sp anish. Most of the time you will find yourself using present or voy \\na, vamos  a. But the future tense does exist and now you know it.\",\n",
       " \"Track 37  \\nT: What was the verb to give , do you remember the verb to give ?  \\nS: Dar.  \\nT: Dar. Good. So how would you say I will give ?   \\nS: Daré .  \\nT: Good.

They, you guys :  \\nS: Darán .  \\nT: And you (informal):  \\nS: Darás .  \\nT: Good. How would you say Will you guys give it to me?

So out of these little words, me and lo, the personal one, the one referring to the person, comes \\nfirst. Will you  guys give it to me? :  \\nS: ¿Me lo darán ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Me lo darán ? What if this it was a feminine thing?  \\nS: ¿Me la darán ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Me la darán ? And I should clarify, this isn’t a way of requesting, like in English, Will you \\nguys give it to me? , like Can yo u guys give it to me?  This is more of a literal question, Are youguys going to give it to me? Will you guys give it to me?  If you want to get this meaning of will \\nyou like can you , you will just use can you  in Spanish. The word for something  is algo. A-l-g-o.  \\nS: Algo .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say They will give you something , and we mean informal you? Remember \\nthe thought process. The thought process must be, first, “Who is doing the verb? Who is doing the \\nverb?” They will give . That’s the firs t place :  \\nS: Darán .  \\nT: You something :  \\nS: Te darán algo .  \\nT: Te darán algo . Good. How would you say They will give it to you , still speaking informally ?  \\nThey will give it to you :  \\nS: Te lo darán .  \\nT: Good. Te lo darán . They will give it to you.  Good. How would you say They will give it to us, they \\nwill give it to us :  \\nS: So it’s Nos lo darán .  \\nT: Good. Nos lo darán . They will not give it to us :  \\nS: No nos lo darán .  \\nT: Good. No nos lo darán . So we saw that me, te, nos can mean me or to me , you or to you, us or to \\nus, or even in some other circumstances for me  or for us , for you . Me, te, nos can also mean myself , \\nyourself , and ourselves . For example, you can say I give myself  and you will just use me. So how \\nwould you say I give myself ?  \\nS: Me doy ?  \\nT: Me doy . If you want to say I realize  in Spanish, you say me doy cuenta . Cuenta  is something like \\naccount , to give yourself account of, to take account of . That’s how you say I realize  in Spanish.If you say realizar  it means to realize  like a project, to bring into fruition, no? So you say I give \\nmyself account , cuenta . So how would you say that?  \\nS: Me doy cuenta .  \\nT: Me doy cuenta . This means I realize. You realize , talking informally?  \\nS: Te das cuenta .  \\nT: Good. Te das cuenta . How would you make tha t a question?  \\nS: ¿Te das cuenta ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Te das cuenta ? This is used a lot conversationally. ¿ Te das cuenta ? Do you realize?  Do \\nyou know what I mean?  Do you know what I’m saying?  Good. We realize, we realize, we give \\nourselves account :  \\nS: Nos damos cu enta.  \\nT: Good. Nos damos cuenta . So me can mean to me , for me , from me . It can mean myself . Te can \\nmean you or to you , from you , yourself . And nos: us, to us , or ourselves  or each other . We said \\nthat you might hear nos vemos – we see each other – as a w ay to say ciao, goodbye . Nos vemos . \\nWe see each other later. See you later . Now, you get all of these different meanings with me, te, \\nand nos, but the ones beginning with l, so lo, la, los, las , they do change to get these different \\nmeanings. So when we sa y to him or to her or to you (formal) or to them  we go from lo and la and \\nlos and las to le and les. So lo and la become le, and los and las become les. For example, lo doy \\nmeans I give it . Now, if I want to say I give him , what I actually mean is I give to him, in which \\ncase here we must change to le. If I say I give her , I don’t mean I’m going to pick her up and give \\nher to somebody. I probably mean I give to her . In which case we’re not going to use la, we’re \\ngoing to use le. So let’s practice this a lit tle bit. So we said dar is to give . Now, if you say I give \\nit, how do you say that?  \\nS: Lo doy .  \\nT: Lo doy . And I give them  and you still are talking about the things you are giving?  \\nS: Los doy .T: Los doy . But now if you want to say I give them  and you mean to them . So remember you might \\nnot even say this to in English. But what you mean is I give to them , then this los is going to change.  \\nS: Les doy .  \\nT: Les doy . Good. The word for something  was?  \\nS: Algo .  \\nT: Algo . So let’s say I’m giving them somethi ng:  \\nS: Les doy algo .  \\nT: Les doy algo . Good. So this is to them . To speak, to speak,  began with a silent h. I don’t know if \\nyou remember this verb.  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar . Good. So how do you say I speak ?  \\nS: Hablo .  \\nT: Hablo . How would you say I have s poken ? I have :  \\nS: He.  \\nT: Yes. He. So I have spoken :  \\nS: He, is it hablando ?  \\nT: No. This is speaking  and spoken  is very similar.  \\nS: He hablado .  \\nT: He hablado . Good. I have spoken to him :  \\nS: Le he hablado .  \\nT: Good. Le he hablado . I have spoken to hi m or to her . Could be either. Now what if you wanted to \\nsay We have spoken to him ?  \\nS: Le hemos hablado .T: Good. Le hemos hablado . So this le, it could be the lo to le, or the la to le. So many meanings are \\nincluded here. It could be We have spoken to him, We have spoken to her, We have spoken to you \\n(formal) , speaking to male or female. Le hemos hablado . How was he has ? Or she has  or it has , \\nfrom haber ?  \\nS: Ha.  \\nT: Ha. Good. H-a. Ha. He has spoken :  \\nS: Ha hablado .  \\nT: Good. They have spoken :  \\nS: Han h ablado .  \\nT: Han hablado . They have spoken about it, they have spoken it :  \\nS: Lo han hablado .  \\nT: Good. They have spoken to him  or to her :  \\nS: Le han hablado .  \\nT: Good. Le han hablado . They have spoken to them . I mean one them  spoken to a different them .  \\nThey have spoken to them :  \\nS: Les han hablado .  \\nT: Very good. Les han hablado . Good. So we had ver, to see . The version for I see  was a little bit \\nirregular, how was it?  \\nS: Veo.  \\nT: Veo. Good. A little bit irregular, not “vo” as it should be, v-o, it’s veo, v-e-o. Good. So if you want \\nto say I see it  or I see him  or I see you , talking formally:  \\nS: Lo veo .  \\nT: Lo veo . What if you saw a feminine thing or if you saw her or if you saw you (formal), talking to \\na female?S: La veo .  \\nT: La veo . What if you were seeing las casas , what if you meant I see them , and you’re referring to \\nfeminine things?  \\nS: Las veo .  \\nT: Las veo . And what else could it mean, then? Other than I see them , talking about things?  \\nS: I see them , meaning women.  \\nT: Or? What else?  \\nS: You, females.  \\nT: Yeah. I see them , females, I see you guys , females, or I see them , feminine objects. Good. We said \\nthat the kitchen  is la cocina and to make the verb you can just stick an r on cocina  and you get?  \\nS: Cocinar .  \\nT: Cocinar , with the accent o n the end. Cocinar . Now in English if I say He’s cooking me something,  \\nI can say He’s cooking me something  or He’s cooking something for me . Both are acceptable in \\nEnglish. So we’re not looking for the direct translation, we’re looking for the feeling more  than \\nanything. We want to identify the feeling of “is it to me , is it for me , or is it directly me?” Is he \\ncooking me?  So it’s the feeling that we want to get our heads around more than the direct \\ntranslation of whether we’re using to or not in English. F or example,  I listen to him . Here we’re \\nusing to in English, with listen . But we don’t use it with hear. I hear him . I listen to him . So we’re \\nnot looking for direct translation of when we’re using to and for or not. What we’re trying to do is \\ngenerally pe rceive, ok, am I being cooked? Am I being spoken? Am I coming out of somebody’s \\nmouth? Ah? Or is it indirect, am I being cooked for? Am I being given to? So, like I said, with me, \\nte and nos it doesn’t matter anyway, because they won’t change. So if I want  to say He’s cooking \\nme, and I mean he’s directly cooking me in the oven, or if I mean he’s cooking something for me, \\nthen the sentence isn’t going to change anyway in Spanish. So how would you say that? He is \\ncooking me something,  he is cooking me somethi ng:  \\nS: Me cocina algo .  \\nT: Good. Me cocina algo . Now let’s say He’s cooking something for us :S: Nos cocina algo .  \\nT: Good. Nos cocina  algo. He’s cooking something for you , speaking informally:  \\nS: Te cocina algo .  \\nT: Good. So me, te, nos we don’t have t o worry about them. They don’t change. But if I want to say \\nHe is cooking him something , how would I say it?  \\nS: Le cocina algo .  \\nT: Very good. How would you say He is cooking them something ?  \\nS: Les cocina algo .  \\nT: Good. Les cocina algo . What if you wa nted to say He is cooking them  and with this them  you are \\nreferring to the things he is cooking? Not to the people he is cooking for.  \\nS: Los cocina algo .  \\nT: Eh, we don’t need the algo anymore.  \\nS: Los cocina .  \\nT: Los cocina . And if he was cooking femi nine things, like las tartas , the tarts , for example, how \\nwould it be? He’s cooking them :  \\nS: Las cocina .  \\nT: Good. Now if you wanted to say He’s cooking them for us  and we still mean feminine things, let's \\nstay with las tartas . He’s cooking them for us , how would it be?  \\nS: Nos las cocina .  \\nT: Perfect. We don’t need for or any of this and we put the personal one first. Nos las cocina . Good.  \\nAgain, what was to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Good. I speak :  \\nS: Hablo .T: Good. I speak to him :  \\nS: Le hablo .  \\nT: Le hablo . Good. And I’m speaking to them :  \\nS: Les hablo .  \\nT: Good. They are speaking to them:   \\nS: Les hablan .  \\nT: Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 38  \\nT: So, we said that lo and la and los and las, become le and les. The four become two. The four \\noptions of lo, la, los, las become le and les when it’s to him, to her, for him, for her . And we said \\nthat me, te, and nos, they don’t change to get these different meanings. They stay as they are. And \\nwe also saw that these words, me, te, and nos could mean myself, yourself, ourselves or each other . \\nSo how would you say I speak to myself ?  \\nS: Me hablo .  \\nT: Me hablo . We speak to ourselves :  \\nS: Nos hablamos .  \\nT: Nos hablamos . Although, of course, the more natural meaning you would probably understand \\nfrom nos hablamos  is we speak to eac h other , as nos also means each other . Now to get the \\nmeaning of himself, herself, themselves, lo and la and los and las become se. Which is very easy \\nto remember because it’s the beginning of self. So when we want this meaning of self or selves , \\nwe get se. So, to recap: me, te, and nos, they already have the meanings included of myself , \\nyourself , ourselves,  each other , but these ones that change, the small words that change, lo, la, los \\nand las, to get the meaning of himself , herself , themselves  is going t o be se. So let’s practice it. He \\nspeaks to himself.  How would you say that?  \\nS: Se habla .  \\nT: Se habla . You could say the word for he. What is the word for he?  \\nS: Él. Él se habla .  \\nT: Él se habla . She speaks to herself , and clarify. Use the word for she.  \\nS: Ella. Ella se habla .  \\nT: Ella se habla . Good. They speak to themselves :  \\nS: Se hablan .  \\nT: Se hablan . Se habla . Se hablan . Se. There’s no change. I speak to myself:S: Me hablo .  \\nT: Me hablo . Good. So here we are not using se. For me, te and nos we h ave all of the meanings \\nincluded in me, te, and nos. Good. Tell me again how is they speak :  \\nS: Hablan .  \\nT: Good, but the accent was -  \\nS: HA-blan .  \\nT: Hablan . They speak to them.  Now a different them.  Not themselves . Ah, they speak to them . This \\ngroup is speaking to another group.  \\nS: Les hablan .  \\nT: So now we can go back to a verb like to stay , to remain was quedar . So to get the meaning of stay, \\nyou say I remain myself . So how was that?  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: Good. Me quedo . We remain ourselves or we stay:  \\nS: Nos quedemos .  \\nT: -ar verb.  \\nS: Nos quedamos .  \\nT: Nos quedamos . Good. And you stay , talking informally. You remain yourself :  \\nS: Te quedas .  \\nT: Te quedas . Are you staying?:   \\nS: ¿Te quedas ?  \\nT: Aren’t you staying? :  \\nS: ¿No te quedas ?  \\nT: Why don’t you stay? :S: ¿Por qué no te quedas ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Por qué no te quedas ? Good. Let’s just practice the words for emphasis as well. So you \\ncould say I am staying.  What is the word for I:  \\nS: Yo.  \\nT: Yo. I’m staying. I’m remaining myself:   \\nS: Yo me que do.  \\nT: Yo me quedo . Good. What was the word for we? Not us, but we?  \\nS: Nosotros .  \\nT: Nosotros . So we have nosotros  for we. How would you say we are staying ? We are remaining \\nourselves :  \\nS: Nosotros nos quedamos .  \\nT: Good. Nosotros nos quedamos . And if you are an all female group, nosotros  will change.  \\nS: Nosotras .  \\nT: Good. Nosotras nos quedamos  if you are an all female group. What is the word for you in the \\nsense of if we want to clarify or emphasize you are staying , speaking informally. Not te, but:  \\nS: Tú.  \\nT: Tú. Good. So how would you say you are staying - emphasizing that we mean you?  \\nS: Tú te quedas .  \\nT: Tú te quedas . Good. So these are the versions actually we were practicing before with me, te, and \\nnos. We didn’t look at he stays , because actu ally what we needed to say he stays is he remains \\nhimself and we didn’t have that yet. But now we do.  \\nS: Se - it’s queda .  \\nT: Good. That’s it. Se queda . He stays. She stays. You stay. They stay,  or they remain themselves :  \\nS: Se quedan .T: Se quedan . Good. Querer  was to want . Querer.  What was I want ?  \\nS: Quiero .  \\nT: Quiero . The / e/ of querer  splits when we put the stress on it. Quiero . Now if you want to say I \\nwant to stay, you say,  I want to remain myself.  So how is that?  \\nS: Quiero quedarme .  \\nT: Go od. Quiero quedarme . He wants to remain himself or she wants to remain herself, he wants to \\nstay, she wants to stay :  \\nS: Quiere quedarse .  \\nT: Good. Quiere quedarse . She wants to stay . Ella quiere quedarse . He wants to stay . Él quiere \\nquedarse . You (formal)  want  to stay . Usted quiere quedarse . What if you wanted to say they \\nwant to stay or you guys want to stay ?  \\nS: Quieren quedarse .  \\nT: Quieren quedarse . So this could mean they want to stay or you guys want to stay . How would you \\nclarify? Let’s clarify they want to stay :  \\nS: Ellos quieren quedarse .  \\nT: Good. And what if it was a female group?  \\nS: Ellas quieren quedarse .  \\nT: Ellas quieren quedarse . Good. And you guys :  \\nS: Ustedes quieren quedarse .  \\nT: Good. Ustedes quieren quedarse . And we said that while usted  is formal, ustedes , the plural you, \\nis not necessarily formal. Quedarse  is the version of the verb that you are going to find in the \\ndictionary. So in the dictionary you will find quedar  and all of the different meanings of quedar  \\nwhich is remain  and the various other meanings, actually, this verb has, could be used like to fit . \\nMe queda bien . It fits me well. It suits me well . And then you will find the next entry: quedarse . \\nAnd then you will find next to it to stay . So when this reflexive, when this  “doing it to oneself” \\ncarries a different meaning, it will get a different entry in the dictionary. And it’s not going to bein the dictionary as quedarme , or quedarte , or quedarnos , but quedarse  because this se is also \\nlike oneself . No? If it’s himself, herself, itself ; it’s also like oneself . So in the dictionary what you \\nfind is to remain oneself . Quedarse . The se is written like one word. Whenever we put se, lo, me, \\nte, nos, one of these small words at the end of the “to” form, it’s written like one wo rd. You write \\nit all together. Let’s practice this just with one more verb. We said that to get the sense of realize, \\nI realize . In Spanish you say to give yourself account . Which is a little bit like to take acount of in \\nEnglish. Now you need to look at darse cuenta  to know how to manipulate it to get the different \\nversions of it that you might want. So let’s begin with I realize. I realize. I give myself account .  \\nS: Me doy - me doy cuenta .  \\nT: That’s it. Me doy cuenta . I don’t realize :  \\nS: No me doy cuent a.  \\nT: No me doy cuenta . Good. We realize , or we give ourselves account :  \\nS: Nos damos cuenta .  \\nT: Good. Nos damos cuenta . Perfect. We don’t realize :  \\nS: No nos damos cuenta .  \\nT: Good. No nos damos cuenta . Now we can make the other versions with he, she, i t and you formal \\nand they and you guys because we have se. So now we can do this. So how would you say he \\nrealizes or she realizes ? Go back to dar.  \\nS: Da- se da cuenta .  \\nT: Good. Se da cuenta . What if we wanted to clarify? She - she realizes :  \\nS: Ella se da cuenta .  \\nT: Good. Ella se da cuenta . Good, and they realize :  \\nS: Se dan cuenta .  \\nT: Good. And they don’t realize :  \\nS: No se dan cuenta .T: No se dan cuenta . So this could be they don’t realize or you guys don’t realize . Well done.',\n",
       " 'Track 39  \\nT: What was the word for with in Spanish? And we have it in words like convenient , confirm  -  \\nS: Oh, con.  \\nT: So con is with and we have it as like a Latin building block in many Latin/English words. \\nConsequence: with sequence . Now in Spanish you do n’t say with her, with him, with them , you \\nactually just say with he, with she, with they . So how would you say with him or with he ?  \\nS: Con él.   \\nT: Con él . With her :  \\nS: Con ella .  \\nT: Con ella . With them :  \\nS: Con ellos.   \\nT: Or, I mean if it was feminine :  \\nS: Oh, ellas.  \\nT: Yeah, con ellas . With us :  \\nS: Nos.  \\nT: Nos is us, but of course in Spanish we won’t say with us , we will say with we .  \\nS: Con nosotros .  \\nT: Yes, con nosotros . What if you were an all female group?  \\nS: Con nosotras .  \\nT: Con nosotras . Good. With you , speaking formally?  \\nS: Con usted .  \\nT: Con usted . And with you guys :  \\nS: Con ustedes .T: Con ustedes . The word for for is para . So how would you say for him ?  \\nS: Para él .  \\nT: Para él . Good. So when you decided that it was para él , you put para and con in the same group.  \\nAnd they are in the same group. They’re in a group of words which are called prepositions. Now \\nprepositions show some kind of movement or position; and they’re very important and interesting \\nwords so it’s useful for us t o identify them as we did with verbs and adjectives and nouns. So we \\nare going to investigate now a little more about prepositions and how they behave in Spanish. So \\nfor him , para él . For her :  \\nS: Para ella .  \\nT: Para ella . Good. For them :  \\nS: Para ellos .  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: Para ellas .  \\nT: Good. And for us :  \\nS: Para nosotros .  \\nT: Para nosotros . Or?  \\nS: Nosotras .  \\nT: Good. Para nosotras  if it’s an all feminine group. Good. Like I said, we don’t say for him , but for \\nhe and we don’t say for her , but for she , with the exception of me and you informal, we get two \\ndifferent versions of the words for me and you. So for me  is para mí. Para mí. And you informal \\nbecomes ti. So for you , speaking informally, is para ti . So this is just after prepositions we get this \\nmí and ti. M-i and t-i. So we can find another preposition that we learned already. The word for of \\nor from . So again this is a small word which is showing movement, direction or position ; these are \\nprepositions. So what was of or from ?  \\nS: De.T: De. Good. So how would you say from him ?  \\nS: De él .  \\nT: Good. De él . From her :  \\nS: De ella .  \\nT: De ella . From me :  \\nS: De mí.  \\nT: Yes. De mí, spelled m-i. From you  speaking informally?  \\nS: De ti.   \\nT: De ti . Good. From them :  \\nS: De ellos .  \\nT: De ellos .  \\nS: Or ellas.  \\nT: Or ellas. Good. De ellas . From us :  \\nS: De nosotros .  \\nT: De nosotros . Good. From you guys :  \\nS: De ustedes .  \\nT: Good. Is it- Is it from you guys? :  \\nS: ¿Es de ustedes ?  \\nT: Good. Is it from you guys?  ¿Es de ustedes ? How would you say it’s for you guys ?  \\nS: Es para ustedes .  \\nT: Good. Es para ustedes . Good. How do you say it is with you guys ?  \\nS: Es con ustedes .T: Now something to me doesn’t feel right here. When we say es de ustedes , it’s from you guys  and \\nes para ustedes , it’s for you guys : we are speaking about things are quite characteristic of whatever \\nthis thing is, whatever this it is. It’s for you guys. It’s from you guys.  But, when we say it’s with \\nyou guys , we are speaking about a state because we are speaking about the location of so mething. \\nSo how do you think it would be - it is with you guys ?  \\nS: Está con ustedes .  \\nT: Very good. Está con ustedes . Very good. To do or to make was hacer . H-a-c-e-r.  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: Hacer . So how do you say he does or he’s doing or he makes or he’s ma king:  \\nS: Ha.  \\nT: This is from haber , but well thought out. [Laughter]  \\nS: So it’s hace .  \\nT: Hace . Good. A favor  is un favor . Un favor . So how would you say he’s doing me a favor ? He’s \\ndoing me a favor :  \\nS: Me hace un favor .  \\nT: Good. Me hace un fav or. Good. How do you say he’s doing her a favor ?  \\nS: La hace un favor .  \\nT: Now if you say la hace , it sounds like he’s making it  - a feminine thing. If you want to say he’s \\ndoing her a favor, for her . So what does la turn to to become to her, for her ?  \\nS: Le hace un favor .  \\nT: Good. Le hace un favor . Good. Decir  is to tell . No? So we have hablar  to speak or to talk  and \\ndecir  is to say or to tell . D-e-c-i-r. So / dethir / in most of Spain . Decir . So how do you say I want \\nto tell, I want to say ? I want, just think of I want.   \\nS: Quiero .  \\nT: To say or to tell :S: Decir .  \\nT: Ah, all together.  \\nS: Quiero decir .  \\nT: Quiero decir . Ah. I want to tell him. I want to tell him :  \\nS: Le quiero decir .  \\nT: Le quiero decir  or?  \\nS: Quiero decirle .  \\nT: Good. You ha ve the option there of where you can put the le, before the changed verb or after the \\ncomplete verb. Le quiero decir. Quiero decirle . But if you want to say, I want to say it :  \\nS: Lo quiero decir .  \\nT: Lo quiero decir . So we see actually with this le, we ar e kind of replacing a preposition with le and \\nles, an imaginary preposition : to, for, from . For example, comprar . Comprar  means to buy . I can \\nsay I buy you something.  Now this you is actually replacing for you . I buy something for you . So \\nwhat is I buy  from comprar ?  \\nS: Compro .  \\nT: Compro . How do you say I buy them  and you refer to the things that you are buying?  \\nS: Los compro .  \\nT: Los compro . But, if you say I buy them and you mean I buy for them :  \\nS: Les compro .  \\nT: Les compro . So this is the most natu ral Spanish structure. Les compro . You use les instead of for \\nthem . But, you could say I buy for them . You could do that if you wanted to, using for them  literally. \\nSo how would you say I buy or I’m buying for them ?  \\nS: Compro para ellos .T: Compro para  ellos . Good. So in an everyday situation, I’m buying something for them , les \\ncompro . Mostly we are going to be avoiding these prepositions, so he buys it for me . I’m just \\ngoing to say he buys me it  rather than he buys it for me . So how would you say that?  He buys me \\nit:  \\nS: Me compra. Me lo compra .  \\nT: Me lo compra . They buy me it or they buy it for me :  \\nS: Me lo compran .  \\nT: Good. Me lo compran . They buy them for me. They buy them for me :  \\nS: Me los compran .  \\nT: Good. Me los compran . Good. Now, we said th at these small words me, nos, te, le, les, most of \\nthe time what we are replacing with them is to, but sometimes it’s like for, like to do a favor for , \\nbut they also might be replacing other prepositions like de. For example, if I want to say he buys \\nit from me , I don’t really need the from  there either. I could just say he buys me it . So how would \\nI say that? He buys it from me. He buys me it :  \\nS: Me lo compra .  \\nT: Me lo compra . So this is totally ambiguous. No? It could mean he buys it for me  or he buys i t from \\nme, but it’s something that we’ll understand from the context. So the key point to take away from \\nhere is that we probably use prepositions much more in English than in Spanish and you just want \\nto kind of like listen out for this and then you will start shedding them. You  will start shedding \\nyour prepositions the more you listen to Spanish.',\n",
       " 'Track 40  \\nT: An interesting thing about prepositions is that they have a habit of changing between languages. \\nTo give you an example, in English we say I fall in love with.  In Spanish, you say I enamor myself \\nof. I fall in love of you . Now again, this is something that we look at with interest rather than \\nlooking at it as an obstacle , for the insight that it might give us about how we perceive and express \\nthe world through our own language. Now the fact that we use with is not necessarily casual. \\nCasual in the sense of meaningless. The fact that we use with is not necessarily without it s weight, \\nwithout it s meaning. If I say I fall in love with you , that pr eposition with necessarily involves you \\nin my process of falling in love. Now this of is much more detached in feeling than with. So there \\nis a school of thought which explores how these elements of language might have a real tangible \\neffect on the way we interact with the world and with certain concepts and the way we express \\nthem and how that feeds back into the way we perceive and view the world. And I think this is a \\nvery nice example between falling in love with and falling in love of. So this is somet hing to think \\nabout and just take interest in whenever you find that in Spanish the verb uses a different \\npreposition than the one it does in English . Rather than just seeing it as a hurdle to correctness that \\nyou need to memorize, maybe have a litt le look at how it might actually be affecting, somehow or \\nother, the way you perceive the world. This also helps the memory on a practical level. You are \\nmuch more capable of internalizing and remembering this difference if rather than just mindlessly \\nmemo rizing that you’re using de instead of con here. We are looking with a more analytical eye, \\nwith a curious eye, to understand what effect this might possibly have on us and in this way we \\nare just going to learn the differences much easier.  \\nLet’s start w ith this verb : To fall in love  is to enamor oneself . So if you look up in the dictionary \\nto fall in love , what you will find is enamorarse , written as one word. Now it’s important to realize \\nthat it is not one word. You still have a verb there ending -ar, enamorar  and then the se is just \\nhooked on. So let’s start with I fall in love . How will you make enamorarse , I fall in love, I enamor \\nmyself ?  \\nS: Me enamoro .T: Exactly. Me enamoro . Now if you want to say I fall in love with you , we’re probably going  to \\nspeak informally. In Spanish we’re not going to say with you , we’re going to say of you . I enamor \\nmyself of you :  \\nS: Me enamoro de ti .  \\nT: Yeah, me enamoro de ti . Very good. I fall in love with him :  \\nS: Me enamoro de él .  \\nT: Good. Me enamoro de él . If we want to give the meaning of I’m falling in love  right now . We can \\nsay I am. How is I am, from estar ?  \\nS: Estoy .  \\nT: Good. Falling in love . Enamoring myself :  \\nS: Enamorándome .  \\nT: Good. It can come actually after the -ando  or before estoy . Estoy enamor ándome . Me estoy \\nenamorando de él . Another verb that chooses a different preposition in Spanish and English is \\nthe verb to think . To think , we said it was related to the word pensive  which means thoughtful.  \\nS: Pensar .  \\nT: Good. Pensar . Now you don’t say I think about you in Spanish. You say I’m thinking or I think in \\nor on you . What was the word for in and on? I think we looked at it very briefly.  \\nS: En.  \\nT: En. Good. So we say I think in you or on you . It’s probably in, actually , because Arabic says it in \\nthis way and of course when languages come into contact , like the 800 years of contact that Spanish \\nand Arabic had, they share a lot more than vocabulary. They also share structures. So we are \\nprobably saying I’m thinking in you  to say I think about you , so how do you say that? I’m thinking \\nabout you or I think about you . Let’s keep it informal.  \\nS: Penso . Sorry, pienso en ti .  \\nT: Pienso en ti . Good. How would you say we think about you , or we’re thinking about you ?S: Pens amos en ti .  \\nT: Pensamos en ti . We think about her , or we think in her , or literally we think in she :  \\nS: Pensamos en ella .  \\nT: Good. Pensamos en ella . To dream  in Spanish is soñar .  \\nS: Soñar .  \\nT: This / ny/ sound like the one we have in mañana  is with the ñ. Ñ is the only letter that we get in \\nSpanish that we don’t get in English and it’s like an n with a little squiggly line on the top of the n \\nand it’s basically n-y. So n with squiggly line on top is n-y, like in mañana . Like in soñar . Soñar . \\nTo dream .  \\nS: Soñar .  \\nT: How do think you say I dream ?  \\nS: Soño .  \\nT: Would be “ soño ”, but what might happen? How is to sleep ?  \\nS: Dormir .  \\nT: Dormir . And I sleep :  \\nS: Duermo .  \\nS: Sueño .  \\nT: Yeah, so this is happening here, but there is really no way to know if i t’s going to happen or not. \\nSometimes it does , sometimes it doesn’t. If it happens for one of the versions, of course it’s going \\nto happen for all of the versions that we stress the o. So, sueño , sueña , sueñan , sueñas .  \\nBut, we dream :  \\nS: Soñamos .  \\nT: Soñamos , because we are not stressing it anymore. Soñamos , we are stressing the /a/. Very good. \\nWe don’t say I dream of  in Spanish. We say I dream with . So here we use with in Spanish. I dreamwith her . The language, we said, is permitting and requiring u s to perceive and express the world \\nin a certain way. So when we say, you know, I dream with her , maybe you can imagine that when \\npeople began to talk about what they were dreaming that they had the idea of the involvement of \\nthe other person. You know, I’m dreaming with you.  You don’t know, but it’s interesting to think \\nabout how that change in the preposition can really affect the way we perceive the world. And then \\nsubconsciously, because even though our beliefs might have modernized , like if I dream abo ut you  \\nI don’t really think you’re there, and I don’t really think you are participating, but the language \\nmight hold an old belief that it is with you. That you are actually participating in my dream. So it’s \\ninteresting to think about, and thinking abou t it is going to help your memory internalize just this \\nsimple fact that the preposition changes. So how would you say I dream about her , or in Spanish, \\nI dream or I’m dreaming with her ?  \\nS: Sueño con ella .  \\nT: Sueño con ella . Good. He dreams about him :  \\nS: Sueña con él .  \\nT: Sueña con él . Good. What was for me ?  \\nS: Para mí.  \\nT: Good. And for you informal?  \\nS: Para ti .  \\nT: Good. And what was from ?  \\nS: De.  \\nT: De. From me :  \\nS: De mí.  \\nT: From you  (informal):  \\nS: De ti .  \\nT: De ti.  Good. With with, we get a little exception. With me  is conmigo  and it’s spelled like one \\nword. So this -go is coming from nowhere and it’s all becoming one word, where de mi , para miare two separate words. So we have conmigo  for with me  and contigo , with you , informal. \\nConmigo . C-o-n-m-i-g-o or contigo , c-o-n-t-i-g-o. So this is with me, with you . What was to come ?  \\nS: Venir .  \\nT: Venir . To come . Good. So how would you say, speaking informally, do you want to come with \\nme?:  \\nS: ¿Quieres venir conmigo ?  \\nT: Good. Don’t yo u want to come with me? :  \\nS: ¿No quieres venir conmigo ?  \\nT: ¿No quieres venir conmigo ? Why don’t you want to come with me? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no quieres venir conmigo ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Por qué no quieres venir conmigo ? What was I have  in the sense of possessi on?  \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo . Good. And if we want to say I have to , we can add something to that tengo . It’s not a \\ncomfortable translation either, if that helps you remember it.  \\nS: Tengo que .  \\nT: Tengo que . Good. So how would you say you have to come with me , again speaking informally ?  \\nYou have to come with me :  \\nS: Tienes que venir conmigo .  \\nT: Tienes que venir conmigo . Good. Good. What was I can , from to be able ?  \\nS: Puedo .  \\nT: Puedo . Can you come with me ? (still informal):  \\nS: ¿Puedes venir conmigo ?T: Good. ¿ Puedes venir conmigo ? So we have conmigo  for with me , contigo  for with you , speaking \\ninformally. So, we could say I dream about you  and we’re going to say I dream with you , speaking \\ninformally.  \\nS: Sueño contigo .  \\nT: Sueño contigo . I’m going with yo u, informally still:  \\nS: I’m going.  I’m forgetting the verbs.  \\nT: You’ll forget them many times and you need to find the way that you, you dig them up. That’s the \\nmost important thing : to take this skill away. So going , what does going  relate to, if anythi ng?  \\nS: Ah, voyage . Voy.  \\nT: You see, I’m going with you , speaking informally:  \\nS: Voy contigo .  \\nT: Very good. To depend , in Spanish, is depender . Depender . How would you say it depends ?  \\nS: Dependa .  \\nT: Make sure before you start to change any verb, you  do a quick check to see what type of verb it is.  \\nS: Depende .  \\nT: Yes, depender , -er verb. Depende . Good. Now in Spanish we don’t say it depends on . We say it \\ndepends of . So how would you say it depends on her or it depends of her ?  \\nS: Depende de ella .  \\nT: Depende de ella . The word for yes and the word for if are the same in Spanish. So you know how \\nto say yes in Spanish?  \\nS: Sí.  \\nT: Sí. Good. So this is also if. It depends on if she wants to go . Let’s say that. It depends :  \\nS: Depende .  \\nT: On or it dep ends of  in Spanish:S: De.  \\nT: Good. If she wants to go :  \\nS: Si quiere ir .  \\nT: Good, so all together. It depends on if she wants to go :  \\nS: Depende de si quiere ir .  \\nT: Good. Depende de si quiere ir . It depends on if she wants to go.',\n",
       " 'Track 41  \\nT: Let’s  look again at how we speak about the future in Spanish. We saw that we have a future tense \\nbut we might not use it very often because, firstly, we can just use the present to talk about the \\nfuture if we have some future context : some word like mañana , tomorrow;  later , más tarde , or \\neven another part of the sentence which shows us that we are talking about the future, we can just \\nuse the present. When we don’t have that we can use ir a, to go to , so voy a , vamos a , vas a , which \\nis also present tense, voy, vas, vamos , it’s present, but we can use it to talk about the future. So, \\nfor example, bailar , bailar , b-a-i-l-a-r, means to dance . We can relate it to ballerina , ballerina \\nactually is just dancer  in Spanish, bailarín  in Spanish is dancer , so that’s where  we get ballerina  \\nfrom: bailar . So, if you want to say we are going to dance :  \\nS: Vamos a bailar .  \\nT: Vamos a bailar . Good. If you had some future context, like later , más tarde , or literally, more \\nlate, you could just say we dance later :  \\nS: Bailamos más tarde .  \\nT: Good. Bailamos más tarde . But you could have used that structure with vamos  if you wanted to, \\nyou have the option. We can say bailamos más tarde or we could say we are going to dance later :  \\nS: Vamos a bailar más tarde .  \\nT: Very good. Vamos a bailar más tarde . So, we saw that we have a future tense, we have a future \\ntense although we might not need to use it very often because we have this situation in Spanish \\nthat we can use the present, or that ir a, to go to , is used even more often than in English, this \\nstructure of I’m going to do it  instead of I’ll do it  is used even more in Spanish than in English. \\nBut, we do have a future tense, and the future tense is luckily very related to the different versions \\nthat we found of the verb haber . Haber  was a very irregular verb, this to have  that we use to go \\ninto the past. What was the trick that we used to find the different versions of this very irregular \\nverb haber ?  \\nS: We used the vowels. The / e/ and / a/ sounds.T: Good. We used these to take off from, we go: “what are the two vowels in haber? / e/ and / a/,” \\nokay . He by itself means:  \\nS: I have .  \\nT: I have . And ha by itself means:  \\nS: He/she/it or you (formal) have .  \\nT: Perfect. And from these we can find the other versions, so we have he for I have , and we have  is:  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Hemos . And we have ha for he/she/it/you  (formal ). For you (informal), what would we do to ha?  \\nS: Has.  \\nT: Has. H-a-s, completely silent, this h, this h that we find in all of these forms. They have or you \\nguys have :  \\nS: Han.  \\nT: Han. So, these are our different versions of haber . Now, these very sounds, so, the sounds, because \\nwe are not including the h, the sound s /e/, /emos /, /a/, /as/, /an/ are the same sounds that we add \\non to the “to” form of the verb to  get this future tense. So, we have a verb like bailar , to dance . If \\nI want to say I will dance , using this future tense, I can look at how is I have  from haber , so, how \\nis I have from haber ?  \\nS: He.  \\nT: He. And I can just stick it on the end. But it’ s the sound that is the same, what we are sticking on \\nthe end of the verb is an e, not the h-e. So, I will dance :  \\nS: Is it “bailáre” or bailaré ?  \\nT: The ending takes the accent and we said that in Spanish we are pushing the accent  into the future, \\nwhich is an interesting phenomenon, we spoke about, how in Greek, for example, in the past you \\npull it back into the past, so we find this phenomenon occurring in other languages as well. Here \\nwe are literally pushing the accent into the future and we accent  that ending and we say bailaré , \\nbailaré , I will dance . We will dance :S: Bailaremos .  \\nT: Bailaremos . He/she/it/you  (formal) will dance :  \\nS: Bailará .  \\nT: Bailará . They or you guys will dance :  \\nS: Bailarán .  \\nT: Bailarán . And you (informal):  \\nS: Bailará s.  \\nT: Bailarás . Good. So, we get the future tense without having to learn anything new, we just have to \\nremember that we can look back at haber  and see what the different versions of haber  were, and \\nthen use them to build our future. So, in fact we have t wo future tenses, let’s say, we have will and \\nwould,  they are both future tenses. Now, -e, -emos, -a, -as, -an, they work for all verbs -er, -ir, -ar, \\nit doesn’t matter ; they are all using these sounds to form will. And we have the same situation with \\nwould. -er, -ir, -ar verbs, they are all together. And our key sound for would  is -ía. So, we add on \\n-ía to the end of the verb, we are accenting it again, because it’s pushing the accent into the future, \\nand this –ía actually gives us I/he/she/it  and you formal. So, here I is jumping in with he/she/it  and \\nyou formal. So, bailaría , bailaría , means I would dance , he would dance, she would dance, you \\n(formal) would dance , or it would dance if you can think of some context where that would make \\nsense. I thin k you can work out what the rest would be. So, let’s try.  \\nHow would you say we would dance ?  \\nS: Bailariámos .  \\nT: Good, the only thing is that the accent stays on the ía.  \\nS: Bailaríamos .  \\nT: Bailaríamos . Good. They or you guys :  \\nS: Bailarían .  \\nT: Bailarían . And you informal:S: Bailarías .  \\nT: Good. So, that’s it, that’s would . So the y, would  and will, share some characteristics, as they are \\nboth different futures . They share the characteristic that we are adding on to the full verb: bailar , \\nbailaré: I will dance , bailar , bailaría : I would dance ; and they share the characteristic that they \\nare stressing the ending, that the accent is going to the ending, and they share the characteristic \\nthat for both futures we group all the verbs together: -ar, -er, -ir verbs, so for both futures we have \\none set of endings for all verb types. What was to go ?  \\nS: Ir.  \\nT: Ir. Good. I would go :  \\nS: Iría.  \\nT: Yes, iría. So, this actually works for I, he, she, it , and you formal. So, in the would  tense we have \\nI jumping in with he, she, it, you  formal. How would you say she wouldn’t go ?  \\nS: No iría .  \\nT: Good. No iría . Good. What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . How would you say I would eat ?  \\nS: Comería .  \\nT: Good. I would eat, but I don’t have time :  \\nS: Comería , pero no tengo... hora ?  \\nT: Tempo , tempo  we have in English.  \\nS: Tiempo .  \\nT: Comería , pero no tengo tiempo . Good. How would you say transformation ?  \\nS: Transformación .  \\nT: Transformación . Good. So, to transform :S: Transformar .  \\nT: Good. Transformar . How would you say it would transform ?  \\nS: Transformaría .  \\nT: Transformaría . This, you would use it if you were to say it would transform something else , so \\nyou could say it would transform the situation , how would you say that, it would transform the \\nsituation ?  \\nS: Transformaría la situación .  \\nT: Transformaría la situación . If you wanted to say it would transform , and you mean it would get \\ntransformed , it would undergo a transformation , then in Spanish you will say it would transform \\nitself . Now, in English we just use the context to understand whether we mean to transform \\nsomething else or it would transform, it would get transformed , but in Spanish most of the time \\nyou are going to want to put that itself . What is that itself ?  \\nS: Se.  \\nT: Good. Itself, se. It would get transformed :  \\nS: Se transformaría .  \\nT: Good. Se transformaría . What is contamination ?  \\nS: Contaminación .  \\nT: Contaminación . To contaminate :  \\nS: Contaminar .  \\nT: Contaminar . If you want to say it contaminates , how would you say it, it contaminates , present \\ntense?  \\nS: Contamina .  \\nT: Contamina . So, contamina  would mean it contaminates, it’s contaminating , maybe we are talking \\nabout the factory and we say contamina . If we want to say, it gets contaminated , we don’t really \\nhave this gets in Spanish, so in Spanish to give this meaning of it gets contaminated  we will justsay it contaminates itself . Now, it doesn’t mean that it’s responsible for its own contamination or \\nthat it is literally contaminating itself, it’s just the structure that we u se to replace this gets that we \\ndon’t have in Spanish. So, if we want to say it gets contaminated , and we are talking about the \\nriver, we will just say it contaminates itself , even though we all understand that what we don’t \\nmean is that the river is a ctually contaminating itself . So how would you say that,  it contaminates \\nitself , or it gets contaminated ?  \\nS: Se contamina .  \\nT: Good. Se contamina . Good. How would you say it would get contaminated ? So, it’s not that  it \\nwould contaminate, it’s it would get contaminated :  \\nS: Se contaminaría .  \\nT: Good. Se contaminaría . What is imagination ?  \\nS: Imaginación .  \\nT: Imaginación . And to imagine :  \\nS: Imaginar .  \\nT: Imaginar . Well done for converting the / j/ to / kh/. Imagination  – imaginación  - imaginar . I \\nimagine :  \\nS: Imagino .  \\nT: Imagino . You will often hear in Spanish  I imagine myself . How would that be?  \\nS: Me imagino .  \\nT: Me imagino . And here it doesn’t really change the meaning. Sometimes adding this myself , or \\nherself , itself , yourself , etc., doesn’t r eally change the meaning very much. Imagino , me imagino , \\nI imagine . How would you say I would imagine ?  \\nS: Me imaginaría .  \\nT: Me imaginaría . Good. I would imagine that he doesn’t want to go : what is this that that we use?  \\nIt’s the same as what .S: Que.  \\nT: Good. So, I would imagine :  \\nS: Me imaginaría .  \\nT: Me imaginaría . That:  \\nS: Que.  \\nT: He doesn’t want to go :  \\nS: No quiere ir .  \\nT: So, all together  I would imagine that he doesn’t want to go :  \\nS: Me imaginaría que no quiere ir .  \\nT: Good. Me imaginaría que no quiere ir .',\n",
       " 'Track 42  \\nT: So we saw for would , the future tense of would , we have our key sound -ía, we have the key sound \\n-ía which we are adding on to the end of the verb, and this gives you the version for I, he, she, it, \\nand you formal. So, for th is one we have I jumping in with he, she, it, you formal. So, we can take \\na verb like hablar  and we can say I would speak . Hablar  is to speak,  and I would speak :  \\nS: Hablaría .  \\nT: Good. Hablaría . Good. We would speak :  \\nS: Hablariámos , hablaríamos .  \\nT: Hablaríamos . They would speak :  \\nS: Hablarían .  \\nT: Good. They wouldn’t speak :  \\nS: No hablarían .  \\nT: No hablarían.  Good. The verb to like  in Spanish is gustar .  \\nS: Gustar .  \\nT: Gustar . So, to like  is gustar , but it works differently in Spanish, and the way it works in Spanish \\nrenders the translation to like  as kind of complicated. It would be much better to translate gustar  \\nas to be pleasing . So, when you say I like it , what we want to say in Spanish is it is pleasing to me.  \\nThat’s the way we say I like it in Spanish, it is pleasing to me . So, if you take gustar  to mean to \\nbe pleasing  or to please , how would you make it is pleasing  or it pleases ?  \\nS: Gusta .  \\nT: Gusta . Good, so that’s it is pleasing  or it pleases . Now, if you want to say it is pleasing t o me :  \\nS: Me gusta .  \\nT: Me gusta . And this is how you say I like it in Spanish, me gusta . So, a very common error that \\nSpanish  learners make is to say me gusto , to translate it like from English literally, I like , and theysay gusto , but what does that me an then actually, if you say me gusto , what does it mean if gustar  \\nmeans to be pleasing ?  \\nS: It means I please myself .  \\nT: Yes, it means I please myself, I like myself . So you want to be careful there, you don’t want to be \\nwalking around telling everybody how much you like yourself,  me gusto mucho . No. Me gusta \\nmucho , it pleases me . So, if you are saying I like them , then of course what you are saying is they \\nplease me , so we must take this inter step, this Spanglish step, to think about it lite rally, to think it \\nthrough literally, so we are sure that we are getting the meaning that we want. So, how would you \\nsay I like them  or they please me  or they are pleasing to me ?  \\nS: Me gustan .  \\nT: Good. Me gustan . Good. So how do you think you would say  I would like, it would please me ?  \\nS: Me gustaría .  \\nT: Good. Me gustaría . So, just like in English, you use this a lot in Spanish. Me gustaría , to eat now , \\nI would like to eat now :  \\nS: Me gustaría comer ahora .  \\nT: Good. Me gustaría comer ahora . We would  like to eat now, it would please us to eat now:   \\nS: Nos gustaríamo , it’s nos gustarían .  \\nT: It, it would please us, to eat now . So, you have this…  \\nS: Is nos gustarían  correct?  \\nT: No, because you have this idea of nos, you have this plural idea and it’s manifesting itself in the \\nverb, so you are not totally in control of your building process at the moment, you are letting some \\nguess work come in, and you need to cut it, you need to start with the verb. It would please us . So, \\nit would please :  \\nS: Gustaría .  \\nT: Exactly. So when you start with the verb you are in control.S: Right.  \\nT: Now you can say it would please us :  \\nS: Nos gustaría .  \\nT: To eat now :  \\nS: Comer ahora .  \\nT: Exactly, very good. Nos gustaría comer ahora . What was to see  or to view ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: Good. Ver. Good.  I would like to see you , let’s speak informally, I would like to see you :  \\nS: Me gustaría verte .  \\nT: Good. Me gustaría verte . A couple of verbs, they contract a little bit when we add on our future \\nendings. So when I say  our future endings, I refer to both futures: will and would . For example, we \\nhave poder  – to be able , and would be able is could : I would be able to go , I could go . So we have \\npoder  – to be able or can, and then we add -ía for would , and it would be podería , but this is a \\nvery common verb, and common verbs are much more subject to change and irregularities, so \\nmany years of podería -podería -podería -podería -podería  – the /e/ got lost, the / e/ fell away, the \\n/e/ of poder . So, I could, he could, she could , it could, you  (formal) could  is podría .  \\nS: Podría .  \\nT: Podría . You can give me the other versions of course. How would you say they could  or you guys \\ncould ?  \\nS: Podrían .  \\nT: Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: Podrías .  \\nT: Good. And we:  \\nS: Podríamos .T: Good. What was to come ?  \\nS: Venir .  \\nT: Venir . Could you come to my house?  How was my house ?  \\nS: Mi casa .  \\nT: Mi casa . Good. So, how would you say Could you come?  And this is to come , we don’t say to here \\nin English, but it’s a second verb, will be in th e “to” form, Could you come to my house?   \\nLet’s speak informally.  \\nS: ¿Podrías venir a mi casa ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Podrías venir a mi casa ? To say or to tell  is decir . So we have hablar , which is to speak \\nor to talk , but to say  or to tell  is decir . Could you tell me something?  Could you tell me something?  \\nAnd we are speaking informally still.  \\nS: ¿Me podrías decir algo ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Me podrías decir algo?  or ¿Podrías decirme algo?  Could you tell me if you want to \\ncome?  So, let’s start with could you tell me if , and  I remind you that if is the same as yes.  \\nS: ¿Podrías decirme si quieres venir ?  \\nT: Okay.',\n",
       " \"Track 43  \\nT: Another verb that contracts in this way, losing its last e, like poder  becoming podría  is haber , to \\nhave . So I would have , how would it be? You're go nna add the -ía on haber , and it's gonna lose \\nit's e like poder  did. So how would it sound?  \\nS: Habría .  \\nT: Habría . So, habría  means I would have , you would have  (formally), he would have, she would \\nhave, it would have . Which means, now you can make senten ces like I would have gone . I would \\nhave eaten something, but... , etc. So let's practice this. How would you say I would have gone ? \\nWhat's to go , first?  \\nS: Ir.  \\nT: Ir. How would you make gone  from to go ? What is the rule to get gone  from to go ? The version \\nthat we need after haber . After any version of haber , doesn't matter if it's he, hemos,  or habría , \\nit's the version of the verb that comes after haber . How do we get that version?  \\nS: Ido.  \\nT: Yes. Ok, I take away -ir, the ending. It's the whole  verb. But whatever, it doesn't matter. I'm taking \\naway the ending, -ir, and I'm putting -ido. Good. I would have gone :  \\nS: Habría ido .  \\nT: Good. Habría ido . We would have eaten , how would that be? We would have eaten :  \\nS: Habríamos comido .  \\nT: Good. Habríamos comido . We could even make a sentence now, like We would have been able \\nto go . We would have been able to go . And as long as you tackle each individual part individually, \\nyou will stay in control. And you will be able to make these apparently reall y complicated \\nsentences, which are actually quite simple because they take the same structure in English and \\nSpanish. So, we would have , how would that be? We would have :  \\nS: Habríamos .T: Good. Been able . So what's to be able , related to power ?  \\nS: Poder .  \\nT: Ahh. Poder  is to be able . How would you make that been able,  or just the version after haber ?  \\nWhat does it do when it comes after haber ?  \\nS: Podido .  \\nT: To go :  \\nS: Ir.  \\nT: Good. Habríamos podido ir . We would have been able to go . Good. You could s ay they would \\nhave been able to eat . So, divide it up block by block, and it is very simple.  \\nS: They would have .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Habrían podido comer .  \\nT: Habrían podido comer . So if you were to say something like they would have come to eat , then \\ncome  is a verb of motion. So how would you say they would have come to eat ?  \\nS: Habrían venido a comer .  \\nT: Habrían venido a comer , because we have venir , a verb of motion, connecting to another to form. \\nGood. With this very useful structure of habría , habrían , habríamos , would have , you could also \\nsay something like I would have liked it . You just need to think in this Spanglish, in this in between \\nlanguage, the literal translation of how we want to say it in English, and then convert it. So, I would \\nhave liked it  is it would have pleased me . It would have pleased me . So to not lose our control  and \\nto stay in control of this process, where is the first place we want our thoughts to go?  \\nS: It would have .  \\nT: Yeah. It would have.  Good. So what is it would have ?  \\nS: Habría .T: Good. Pleased . So it's gustar  after haber . So maybe it's better to think of it in this way, “I'm \\nfinding the version of the verb after haber ,” instead of actually trying to find the translation of the \\nword, because the versions after have  are so different in English. We have eaten, gone, walked , so \\nif we are looking for walked, gone , or eaten , and we forget that it's just the version after haber , we \\nmight be looking for a very long time, ah? So, the version after haber , we have -ado or -ido, no?  \\nS: Gustado .  \\nT: Good. So now we can make the sentence, It would have pleased me , I would have liked it .  \\nS: Me habría gustado .  \\nT: Good. Me habría gustado.  Good. So, I would have liked it . How would you say we would have \\nliked it – so - it would have p leased us ?  \\nS: So it's nos habría gustado .  \\nT: Very good. Nos habría gustado . And maybe, you might want to say we would have liked them . \\nFirst give me the Spanglish, the literal translation in English. So we want to say we would have \\nliked them . What is the literal translation of how we put it into Spanish?  \\nS: They would have pleased us.   \\nT: Perfect. Well done. They would have pleased us.  So now you have all you need to make that \\nsentence.  \\nS: Habrían . Nos habrían gustado .  \\nT: Good. Nos habrían gustado , they would have pleased us, we would have liked them . So we just \\nsaw some complicated structures with this would , which is especially useful because we can make \\ncould , and we can make would have . We can also make should  with this would . What was to owe , \\nor must , which was related to debt in English?  \\nS: Deber .  \\nT: Deber . Good. -er verb. Deber . Now if you say would owe , this means should . How would you say \\nthen, I should, he should, it should, she should, you ( formal) should ?  \\nS: Debería .T: Yes. Debería . Good. How would you say you should come to my house ? You should come to my \\nhouse  (informal) :  \\nS: Deberías venir a mi casa .  \\nT: Good. Deberías venir a mi casa . Good. You should come to my house to eat . You should come to \\nmy house to eat:  (Informally, st ill.)  \\nS: Deberías venir a mi casa a comer .  \\nT: Good. Deberías venir a comer a mi casa , or deberías venir a mi casa a comer , both are perfectly \\nfine. Well done. How would you say we should ?  \\nS: Deberíamos .  \\nT: Good. How would you say we should speak ?  \\nS: Deberíamos hablado .  \\nT: Here, speak  is to speak . The confusion might come that in English, after can, after should , after \\nmust , we don't say to. I must eat , not I must to eat . I can eat , not I can to eat . In Spanish, you're \\njust using the to form afterw ards. So, we should speak, we should speak:   \\nS: Deberíamos hablar .  \\nT: Good. We should speak . Deberíamos hablar . We should speak about it:  (And we said we don't \\nneed about .)  \\nS: Deberíamos hablarlo .  \\nT: Good. Deberíamos hablarlo . We should speak about it , we should speak it . What if you wanted \\nto say we should speak to him ?  \\nS: Deberíamos hablarle .  \\nT: Good. Deberíamos hablarle . This could actually be to him  or to her  or to you  (formal), no? \\nDeberíamos hablarle . What if you wanted to say we should speak t o them  or we should speak to \\nyou guys ?  \\nS: Deberíamos hablarles .T: Good. Deberíamos hablarles . How would you say we should speak with him ?  \\nS: Deberíamos hablar con él .  \\nT: Good. And with her :  \\nS: Con ella .  \\nT: All together?  \\nS: Deberíamos hablar con  ella.  \\nT: Good. So choosing these structures, you get around the ambiguity of deberíamos hablarle , which \\ncould mean him or her or you (formal). Now if we use con, we see very clearly who we mean. \\nDeberíamos hablar con él. Deberíamos hablar con ella . Good.  To give  is dar. Dar. To give . \\nHow would you say I would give ?  \\nS: Daría .  \\nT: Daría . They would give:   \\nS: Darían   \\nT: Good. They would give me,  or to me :  \\nS: Me darían.   \\nT: Good. They would give me it :  \\nS: Me lo darían.   \\nT: Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 44  \\nT: What was the  word for problem  in Spanish?  \\nS: Problema .  \\nT: Problema . And the problem:   \\nS: El problema .  \\nT: El problema . Good. We can see it ends in an a, so we would expect it to be feminine, but we saw \\nthat these words ending -ma in Spanish, many of them entered t hrough Greek. And in Greek they're \\nneuter, but they look a bit masculine in Greek, so they came into Spanish as masculine words even \\nthough they end in a. So we have el problema . System :  \\nS: Sistema .  \\nT: Sistema . The system :  \\nS: El sistema .  \\nT: Good. The p aradigm: how do you think that would be in Spanish?  \\nS: El paradigma .  \\nT: El paradigma . Good. Scheme  also came in from Greek. But scheme  in Spanish means outline  or \\ndiagram . How do you think that would be?  \\nS: El squima . Squema . El squema .  \\nT: Good, and s omething else to make it sound a bit more Spanish?  \\nS: El esquema .  \\nT: Very good. El esquema . We said that we cannot start s plus another consonant in Spanish. We \\nhave to put an e before, like Spain , España , spaghetti , espagueti . El esquema , so this would be \\noutline  or diagram . Diagram  is another one of these words. How do you think that would be in \\nSpanish?  \\nS: Diagrama .T: Good. And the diagram :  \\nS: El diagrama .  \\nT: El diagrama . Good. So mostly, words ending / o/ are masculine and words ending / a/ are fem inine, \\nbut we might find some exceptions. Planeta , for example, what do you think that means? Planeta :  \\nS: Planet .  \\nT: Planeta  is a masculine word. So the planet :  \\nS: El planeta .  \\nT: El planeta . A planet :  \\nS: Un planeta .  \\nT: Un planeta , very good. How woul d you say the planets ?  \\nS: Los planetas .  \\nT: Very good, los planetas . Good. So this is a masculine word that looks feminine. How was the \\nword for car? We saw various words.  \\nS: Auto .  \\nT: Auto , let's work with that one. How do you say the car ?  \\nS: El auto .  \\nT: The cars :  \\nS: Los autos .  \\nT: Los autos . Good. If you want to say this car , you say este auto . Este auto .  \\nS: Este auto .  \\nT: Good. We sa w esta noche , this night . What do you think is the difference between este and esta, \\nthen? If we have este auto  and esta noche , what do you think is the difference?  \\nS: Este is the masculine  -T: Good.  \\nS: And esta the feminine.  \\nT: Good. So, we see that noche  is a feminine word. How would you say the night ?  \\nS: La noche .  \\nT: La noche . The nights :  \\nS: Las noches .  \\nT: Good. But this night , or tonight :  \\nS: Esta noche .  \\nT: Esta noche . Good. If you take this t out of este and esta, the words for this, you get the word for \\nthat. So este auto  is this car . And that car  would be?  \\nS: Ese auto .  \\nT: Ese auto . How would you say I want that car ?  \\nS: Quiero ese auto .  \\nT: Good. I don't want that car, because it's very big. Big  is grand  so how would that be in Spanish?  \\nS: Grande .  \\nT: Grande . I don't want that car , because it's very big :  \\nS: No quiero ese auto, porque es muy grande .  \\nT: Very good. No quiero ese auto, porque es muy grande . How was this night ?  \\nS: Esta noche .  \\nT: And how would be that night ?  \\nS: Esa noche.   \\nT: Esa noche . We just get rid of the t and then we have the word for that. What if you wanted to say \\nthose n ights ?S: Esas noches .  \\nT: Esas noches . Good. There are also a few words that end in o which are feminine. For example, \\nmano . Mano  means hand . Ends in o, but it's a feminine word. So how would you say the hand ?  \\nS: La mano .  \\nT: La mano . Good. The hand s:  \\nS: Las manos .  \\nT: Las manos . This hand :  \\nS: Esta mano .  \\nT: Good. That hand :  \\nS: Esa mano .  \\nT: Good. These hands :  \\nS: Estas manos .  \\nT: Good. We have this word in English, like in manuscript , manual , as well. Manual , manuscript , \\nthat man- bit there means  hand . Maintain , which in Spanish is mantener . We have main - or man- \\nmeans hand . Manage . Manage  means to handle . Actually, it has a special use for handling horses, \\nhistorically. Which is interesting, because to manage , manejar , is used in some Latin Ameri can \\ncountries to mean to drive . Other than to manage  or to handle , it also means to drive , manejar , \\nwhich is interesting because this verb manage  historically had the special use to handle horses, \\nand we see how that's kind of translated over the years to driving. How would you say Can you \\ngive me a hand? So this is a literal translation of something idiomatic in English, but it works in \\nSpanish as well. In Spanish you say this. Can you give me a hand?  And let's talk informally.  \\nS: ¿Me puedes dar un mano ?  \\nT: But it's -  \\nS: Una mano .T: Good. ¿Puedes darme ?, or ¿me puedes dar ?, una mano . How would you say Could you give me \\na hand? Could you give me a hand? So could  is would can.   \\nS: ¿Me podrías dar una mano ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Me podrías dar una mano ? ¿Podrías  darme una mano ? You should give me a hand. \\nYou should give me a hand. Should is would owe . Still informal.  \\nS: Deber . Debería . You should . Deberías . Me deberías dar una mano .  \\nT: Me deberías dar una mano . Here we're not asking though, it sounded like a question.  \\nS: Oh, sorry.  \\nT: You should give me a hand.   \\nS: Oh, yes.  \\nT: Give it to me again, not like a question. Like a statement. You should give me a hand :  \\nS: Deberías darme una mano .  \\nT: Good. And what if you were speaking to more than one person?  \\nS: Deberían darme una mano .  \\nT: Good. Deberían darme una mano . You guys should give us a hand :  \\nS: Nos deberían dar una mano .  \\nT: Good. So we said that manejar  means to handle  or to manage . Manejar .  \\nS: Manejar .  \\nT: And also to drive , in some Latin Amer ican countries. How do you say I am managing the problem , \\nor I manage the problem ?  \\nS: Manejo el problema .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I'm managing the problem , and you mean right now. So I remind \\nyou that for managing , for -ar verbs to get this -ing, we take away -ar and we put -ando . And for-er/-ir verbs, for this -ing, we take away the -er or the -ir, and we put -iendo . First part is I am \\nmanaging. I am managing:   \\nS: Estoy manejando .  \\nT: Good. I am managing the problem :  \\nS: Estoy manejando el  problema .  \\nT: Good. Estoy manejando el problema . So mano , we said, ends in o and it's feminine. It's actually \\nkind of the only true word that ends in o and is feminine. So, for example we have la foto , the foto . \\nBut foto is short for fotografía . So it's a ctually la fotografía  becomes la foto . The same with la \\nmoto . The motorbike  is actually la motocicleta . No? Then people say moto  and foto and it stays \\nwith la. To take  in Spanish is tomar . Tomar .  \\nS: Tomar .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I'm taking a photo , and you mean right now?  \\nS: Estoy tomando una foto .  \\nT: Good. Estoy tomando una foto . You might hear sacar  as well, for photo. Sacar  or tomar . Estoy \\ntomando una foto. Estoy sacando una foto . Let's use tomar  for now. I would take a photo :  \\nS: Tomaría una foto.  \\nT: Tomaría una foto . I would like , so it would please me , to take a photo . So what is to please , or \\nlike?  \\nS: Gustar .  \\nT: Gustar . So it would please me,  I would like,  it would please me to take a photo:   \\nS: Me gustaría tomar una foto .  \\nT: Good. Me gustaría tomar una foto . But I don't have my camera. But I don't have my camera:   \\nS: Pero no tengo mi cámara .  \\nT: Good. All together. I would like to take a photo, it would please me to take a photo, but I don't \\nhave my camera :S: Me gustaría tom ar un foto -  \\nT: Fotografía.   \\nS: Una foto, pero no tengo mi cámara .  \\nT: Very good. Me gustaría tomar una foto, pero no tengo mi cámara . Very good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 45  \\nT: So how was to like , or we said that the translation that we would give it in Spanish was to ple ase \\nor to be pleasing to ?  \\nS: Me gusta .  \\nT: So, the \"to\" version?  \\nS: Gustar .  \\nT: Gustar . Good. So how would you say we like it,  and we want to take the route of the literal \\ntranslation, so it is pleasing to us ?  \\nS: Nos gustamos .  \\nT: So remember the fi rst place you want your thoughts to go. This is very important, ah.  \\nS: Well, so gustar  becomes gustamos .  \\nT: It is pleasing, to us . So, it is pleasing:   \\nS: Gusta .  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: Nos gusta .  \\nT: Nos gusta . We were saying that gustar , we can translate as to pl ease or to be pleasing . Now it \\nwould probably make more sense for us to store it as to be pleasing . Because, if we want to say \\nsomething like she likes it , what we will say is it is pleasing to her . So we have the to her  with \\ngustar , so that\\'s why it makes  more sense to translate it as it is pleasing to her  rather than it pleases \\nher. This way we store this idea of to. So what is to her ?  \\nS: Le.  \\nT: Le. Good. So we have la for her, and to her , le. So if you want to say it is pleasing to her , or she \\nlikes it , how would it be?  \\nS: Le gusta .T: Le gusta . And it is pleasing to them , or they like it :  \\nS: Les gusta .  \\nT: Good. Les gusta . You had a little battle there, right, with whether it was gustan  or not. Good. And \\nyou take control of that going it is pleasing , gusta . It is pleasing to them , les gusta . So with gustar , \\nwe\\'re not using lo and la and los and las. We\\'re using le and les. They like it, it is pleasing to them . \\nLes gusta . How would you say they like them , or they are pleasing to them ?  \\nS: Les gustan .  \\nT: Good. Les gustan . He likes them , or they are pleasing to him:   \\nS: Le gustan .  \\nT: Very good. So there are a couple of other verbs as well that we would prefer to give this kind of \\ntranslation to. What do you think interesar  means? Interesar :  \\nS: Inter esting .  \\nT: Interesante  is interesting . What does interesar  look like? It might not be, but what does it look \\nlike? Interesar . What type of word does it look like?  \\nS: It\\'s a verb.  \\nT: Ah.  \\nS: So it\\'s to interest .  \\nT: Good. To interest . Good. So this helps  us with comprehension as well, understanding what are our \\ntypes of words and what they tend to look like. So we could translate it as to interest , or we could \\ntranslate it as to be interesting to . And here in this case, it\\'s another verb like gustar , in t hat it \\nmakes more sense to translate it for ourselves as to be interesting to , because it goes with le and \\nnot lo. So in our minds this fits then in the Spanish structure if we save that translation as to be \\ninteresting to  rather than to interest . So how w ould you say it interests me, it is interesting to me ?  \\nS: Me interesa .  \\nT: Good. Me interesa . Does it interest you?  Let\\'s speak informally. Does it interest you? :S: ¿Te interesa ?  \\nT: ¿Te interesa ? Doesn\\'t it interest you?:   \\nS: ¿No te interesa ?  \\nT: ¿No te interesa ? Why doesn\\'t it interest you? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no te interesa ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Por qué no te interesa ? So if we want to say it interests him , what we\\'re really saying is \\nit is interesting to him . So we want to him  here. So how would you say that? It interests him  or it\\'s \\ninteresting to him :  \\nS: Le interesa .  \\nT: Good. Le interesa . They\\'re interested in it. It\\'s interesting to them :  \\nS: Les interesa .  \\nT: Good. Les interesa . You remember how was to dance , related to ballerina ?  \\nS: Bailar .  \\nT: Bailar . Good . So you can ask does it interest her to dance tonight? Does it interest her to dance \\ntonight? :  \\nS: ¿Le interesa bailar esta noche ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Le interesa bailar esta noche ? Good. Salir , salir is to leave  or to go out . To leave  or to \\ngo out . So you can say  does it interest her, is it interesting to her to go out to dance tonight? Does \\nit interest her to go out to dance tonight? So let\\'s go from the beginning, does it interest her? :  \\nS: ¿Le interesa ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Le interesa ? And of course le interesa  could me an does it interest her , does it interest \\nhim, does it interest you  (formal). We don\\'t know by the le. Le interesa , to go out to dance tonight:   \\nS: Salir a bailar esta noche .T: Good. So here we have a because salir  is a verb of coming and going. ¿ Le inte resa salir a bailar \\nesta noche ? Now what if you wanted to ask would it interest you , would it be interesting to you , \\ninformally? So what was our sound for would , that we add on to the “to” form of the verb?  \\nWhat\\'s our key sound for would ?  \\nS: -ía  \\nT: -ía, good. Would it interest you? :  \\nS: Interaría .  \\nT: Slower.  \\nS: Interesar , interesaría . ¿Te interesaría ?  \\nT: Good. Another verb like this is parecer . Parecer , which is to seem . But, in English we already put \\nto. It seems to me. It seems to him.  So how do you say it seems to m e? Parecer  is to seem . It seems \\nto me :  \\nS: Me paresa .  \\nT: Before you change a verb, there\\'s something very quick and very essential that you must do.  \\nS: It\\'s an -er, not an -ar.  \\nT: Yes. You must go back to your takeoff point, which is the \"to\" form, and make a quick check.  \\nParecer , -er verb. Ok, I know where I am, I know what I\\'m doing.  \\nS: Me parece .  \\nT: Me parece . It seems to me. It seems to me that . What is this that that we put here? Same as what :  \\nS: Que.  \\nT: Que. Spanish  kind of highlights for you that what  is the question version of that. It kinds of shows \\nyou that much more clearly than English does. But English shows you as well. If you think, in \\nEnglish if you take the word that and you get rid of the t and you replac e it with a w, you get what . \\nIn the same way that if you take the word there  and you get rid of the t and you replace it with w,you get where . Or if you take the word then and get rid of the t and replace it with w, you get when . \\nSo you have que for that, and then qué for what . Same word. So, it seems to me that :  \\nS: Me parece que .  \\nT: He doesn\\'t want to go out tonight.  He doesn\\'t want to go out tonight :  \\nS: No quiere salir esta noche .  \\nT: Good. Me parece que no quiere salir esta noche . Good. How would you  say it seems to me that \\nhe doesn\\'t like it ? It seems to me that he doesn\\'t like it.  Now in English, this that is optional. No?  \\nIt seems to me he doesn\\'t like it.  It seems to me that he doesn\\'t like it.  It\\'s optional. But in Spanish, \\nit\\'s obligatory. You want to put this that. And actually, it\\'s really gonna help you think out your \\nsentences to put that always. So, it seems to me that he doesn\\'t like it :  \\nS: Me parece que no lo gusta. Le. No le gusta .  \\nT: Good. You might want to say me parece bien . That wo uld mean it seems good to me , it seems fine \\nto me . But we\\'re not using the word good , we\\'re using the word well. Bien . Me parece bien . It \\nseems to me well . You\\'ll find a little gray area between English and Spanish about when we say \\ngood , bueno , and when we say well, bien. But it\\'s something you\\'ll pick up listening. So here you \\nwould say well, it seems well to me , it seems good to me :  \\nS: Me parece bien .  \\nT: Good. Me parece bien . It doesn\\'t seem good to me :  \\nS: No me parece bien .  \\nT: Good. No me pare ce bien . It doesn\\'t seem good to her , or to him , or to you  (formal):  \\nS: No le parece bien .  \\nT: Good. Now let\\'s make it a question. Doesn\\'t it seem ok to you? :  \\nS: ¿No le parece bien ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ No le parece bien ? What was to interest ?  \\nS: Interesar .T: Interesar . How would you say it would interest me,  it would interest me ?  \\nS: Me interesaría .  \\nT: Good. It would interest me to see it :  \\nS: Me interesaría verlo .  \\nT: Good. To put , we said was poner . Poner .  \\nS: Poner .  \\nT: Poner . And we said that it\\'s an i nteresting verb because when we have -pose inside a verb in \\nEnglish, we can change that -pose to poner  and we get the verb in Spanish. So for example, to \\ncompose  in Spanish is componer . And this com- is actually con-. The n changes next to the p, so \\nit literally means “with putting”. To compose  is “with putting”, putting together. Compose , \\ncomponer . To suppose :  \\nS: Suponer .  \\nT: Suponer . To oppose :  \\nS: Oponer .  \\nT: Oponer . To impose :  \\nS: Imponer .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I want to put it here? I want t o put it here :  \\nS: Quiero ponerlo aquí .  \\nT: Good. Quiero ponerlo aquí . I would like to put it here.  It would please me :  \\nS: Me gustaría ponerlo aquí .  \\nT: Good. Now if you want to say I want to put salt on it , you don\\'t need to say on. What do you think \\nyou can replace this on it with? So instead of saying on it, what do you think you might be able to \\nsay in Spanish? What is the word for it:  \\nS: Lo.T: And what do you think you could to do that to make it like on it? How do you say to it:  \\nS: Ah, lo.  \\nT: Th is is not how you say to it.  \\nS: No, it\\'s not.  \\nT: Ah, so how do you say to it, for it, from it :  \\nS: Le.  \\nT: Le. So, if you want to say I want to put salt on it , you don\\'t say on it, you just say le. Salt is sal, \\nsal. So how would you say I want to put it salt, and with this it we mean on it.  \\nS: Quiero ponerle sal .    \\nT: Good. Quiero ponerle sal . I would like to put salt on it :  \\nS: Me gustaría ponerle sal .  \\nT: Good. Me gustaría ponerle sal . A little , a little is un poco . Un poco . Literally a little , un poc o.  \\nS: Un poco .  \\nT: Good. So you could say I would like to put it a little more , what was the word for more , like in \\nmore late ?  \\nS: Más.  \\nT: I would like to put it a little more salt , I would like to put on it a little more salt :  \\nS: Me gustaría ponerle un  poco más sal .  \\nT: Very good. Me gustaría ponerle un poco más sal . What if you wanted to say I would like to put \\non them a little more salt ? You know maybe you mean las papas fritas . The chips , the french \\nfries. I would like to put on them a little more sa lt:  \\nS: Me gustaría ponerles un poco más sal .  \\nT: Very good. Me gustaría ponerles un poco más sal .',\n",
       " 'Track 46  \\nT: In English we have many ways to talk about the past. If you get any random verb like to eat , for \\nexample, you can say I ate . You can say I have eaten . You can say I was eating . You can say I \\nused to eat . You can say I would eat an ice cream every week when I was a child , and there you \\nuse would  to speak about the past in English. I would go to the cinema every day when I was young . \\nSo we have many  different ways of talking about the past, but we can divide them into three. And \\nin Spanish there are three. We have the I have eaten  past, which is the one that we learnt already. \\nI have eaten , with haber . And then the other two pasts we can think of as a line in the past and a \\ndot in the past. So, what would fit into the line in the past is I was eating , I used to eat , I would eat \\nall the time when I was younger , all of that is ongoing. It’s like a line in the past. But then the dot \\nin the past is I ate, finished. I ate, that’s your dot in the past. Those are what we will consider our \\nthree different pasts, which all of the different ways of expressing the past in English fit into, and \\nin Spanish we have these three forms. The one we learnt already is I have eaten , for example. First \\nwe need to manage the verb to have . What is the verb for to have  in this context?  \\nS: Haber .  \\nT: Haber . Good. So we have haber , and we had a neat trick to find the different versions of haber , \\nas we know it’s very irregular. S o what is I have ?  \\nS: He.  \\nT: Good. And we have :  \\nS: Hemos .  \\nT: Good. And what is he/she/it/you  (formal) have  or has?  \\nS: Ha.  \\nT: Good. And you, informally:  \\nS: Has.  \\nT: Good. And they have  or you guys have :  \\nS: Han.T: So that’s our panorama of haber . And then we need to find eaten . So, the version after haber , we \\nwant to think of it in this way, the version of the verb that comes after haber , rather than trying to \\ntranslate eaten  because the version of the verb that comes after have  in English is oft en so different. \\nI have wanted . I have been . Very different. But in Spanish, for –ar verbs we take off -ar and \\nput -ado, and for –er/-ir verbs we take off the -er or -ir and we put -ido. So I have eaten :  \\nS: He comerido . Sorry, comido .  \\nT: Good. You’re tak ing off your ending and putting -ido. The only times we’re adding onto the “to” \\nforms is with the futures, will and would . He comido . I have spoken :  \\nS: He hablado .  \\nT: He hablado . Good. I have danced :  \\nS: He bailado .  \\nT: Good. They have danced :  \\nS: Han ba ilado .  \\nT: Han bailado . The version that comes after haber : comido , bailado , doesn’t change for I or for \\nwe or for they or for he or she. Always the same. We need to focus on haber  to get the correct \\nversion of haber , and then we have the version of the ve rb that comes after it. So he bailado , han \\nbailado , hemos bailado . We can also say more complicated things like I have been able to eat . \\nWhat is to be able , related to power ?  \\nS: Poder .  \\nT: Poder . Good. So I have been able , the version that comes after haber. Rather than translating been \\nable, we just want poder  after haber , so let’s do that first. I have been able :  \\nS: He podido .  \\nT: To eat :  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Good. He podido comer . I have been able to eat.  I haven’t been able to eat :S: No he podido comer .  \\nT: Good. No he podido comer . So we can make more interesting structures as well, like this, using \\nhaber . We can also put haber  in would  time, which gives us the opportunity to make some useful \\nstructures. What is our sound for would ?  \\nS: -ía.  \\nT: So I woul d have  from haber :  \\nS: Habría .  \\nT: Good. The /e/ fell out. Habría . What was to leave or to go out ?  \\nS: Salir .  \\nT: Salir . So you can say I would have gone out.  I would have gone out:   \\nS: He saliría ?  \\nT: So you’ve taken the sentence as a block to translate  it all together, and then you have this kind of \\nsalad situation where this -ía’s coming out in the wrong place. You must take the time to divide it \\nup. I would have  is your first bit, and you stop there. I would have , what’s that?  \\nS: Habería . Habría .  \\nT: Habría . Good, and it’s a very natural irregularity. You can imagine many years of saying habería , \\nhabería , habería , habería , habería , it happens very naturally for that e to fall out. It only happens \\nwith a few verbs, though. Habría . So I would have gone out:  \\nS: Habría salido .  \\nT: Habría salido . Good. I would have been able to go out.  I would have been able to go out :  \\nS: Habría podido salir .  \\nT: Good. Habría podido salir . I wouldn’t have been able to go out.  I wouldn’t have been able to go \\nout:  \\nS: No ha bría podido salir .T: Good. No habría podido salir . Good. So we have this haber  that we can use for the past, but then \\nalso we can make some other very useful structures out of it, like would have , would have been \\nable, etc. So now we’re going to focus on  another past in Spanish. We’re going to focus now on \\nthe line in the past. So the line in the past representing I was eating , I used to eat , I would eat all \\nthe time , that would  that we use for past. All of those are represented by this line in the past. Now, \\nfor the pasts – for both pasts, the line and the point – again we are taking off our verb ending before \\nwe add on our endings for the past. So we have a verb like hablar , for example, an –ar verb, and \\nwe will take off this -ar and we will put -aba, -aba, to get I/he/she/it/you (formal). So again, like \\nin would  time, we have I jumping in with he, she, it , and you (formal). So you have hablar , you \\ntake off the -ar and you put -aba:  \\nS: Hablaba .  \\nT: Hablaba . Hablaba . So hablaba  means I was speaking , I use d to speak , he was speaking , she was \\nspeaking , he used to speak , she used to speak , you were speaking , you used to speak , all of this in \\nhablaba . Now you can probably make the other versions. How would you say you were speaking , \\nspeaking informally ?  \\nS: Hablabas .  \\nT: Good. And they or you guys were speaking :  \\nS: Hablaban .  \\nT: Hablaban . And for the we version, the accent’s going to stay in the same place on -aba. So how \\nwould you say we were speaking ?  \\nS: Hablábamos .  \\nT: Hablábamos . Good. To wait  is esperar . Esperar , to wait  or to hope .  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: So how would you say I was waiting , I used to wait ?  \\nS: Esperaba .T: Good. I was waiting for you , speaking informally? And we don’t need the for, no? I was awaiting \\nyou:  \\nS: Te esperaba .  \\nT: Te esp eraba . What if you were speaking formally? If you were speaking to usted  and you wanted \\nto say I was waiting for you :  \\nS: Is it lo?  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: Lo esperaba .  \\nT: Or to a female, it would be?  \\nS: La esperaba .  \\nT: Good. So lo and la other than it and he and she can also mean you (formal). We see those are \\nalways pairing together – he, she, it , and you (formal). Keeping it formal, speaking to usted , how \\nwould you say We were waiting for you ?  \\nS: Lo esperábamos .  \\nT: Good. Lo esperábamos . Very good. And what i f you wanted to say We were waiting for you guys ?  \\nS: Los esperábamos .  \\nT: Los esperábamos . And of course, this could also mean We were waiting for them . Los \\nesperábamos . To try , related to intent:   \\nS: Intentar .  \\nT: Good. Intentar . So how would you say I was trying ?  \\nS: Intentaba .  \\nT: Good. Intentaba . He was trying :  \\nS: Intentaba .  \\nT: Good. What was to find , to encounter ?S: Encontrar .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say They were trying to find it? They were trying to find it:  so divide up \\nthe thoughts. They were trying , the first bit :  \\nS: Intentaba ? It’s intentaban .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Encontrarlo .  \\nT: Good. Intentaban encontrarlo . If you wanted to say They were trying to find it for me , the most \\nnatural way of saying this in Spanish is They were trying to f ind me it . They were trying to find me \\nit:  \\nS: Intentaban encontrármelo .  \\nT: Intentaban encontrármelo . Good. They were trying to find me it.  But if you wanted to emphasize \\nThey were trying to find me it, then you could say this sentence in the way that we would probably \\nsay it in English, which is They were trying to find it for me.  Then you could do that in Spanish. \\nYou have that option. So how would you say that? They were trying to find it for me , using the \\nword for:  \\nS: Intentaban encontrarlo para mí .  \\nT: Good. Intentaban encontrarlo para mí . So here we are emphasizing, actually me. But mostly in \\nSpanish we kind of avoid the use of the preposition, as we’ve been noticing. Intentaban \\nencontrármelo .',\n",
       " \"Track 47  \\nT: The dinner  in Spanish is la cena , spel t c-e-n-a, la cena .  \\nS: La cena .  \\nT: La cena . Those in Spain will pronounce /la thena/. So la cena , the dinner . Now, to dine , which \\ndoesn’t sound formal in Spanish as it does in English, to dine , you just make la cena  into a verb.  \\nSo how do you think that wou ld sound?  \\nS: Cenar .  \\nT: Cenar . Good. So cenar  is to dine . So how would you say I was dining,  or more naturally in \\nEnglish, I was having dinner ?  \\nS: Cenaba .  \\nT: Good. Cenaba . Now, apart from I was having dinner , what else can that mean? Cenaba ?  \\nS: He/sh e/it were having dinner.   \\nT: And? Who else?  \\nS: You (formal).  \\nT: Good. So we have all of those meanings there with the -aba. So for this line in the past we have -aba \\nfor -ar verbs. We are taking off our -ar and we're putting -aba as our key sound, and th en we are \\nadding on more, so n or s. Quemar , q-u-e-m-a-r, quemar in Spanish is to burn.   \\nS: Quemar .  \\nT: Quemar . Good. How would you say He was burning the dinner ? He was burning the dinner :  \\nS: Quemaba la cena .  \\nT: Good. Quemaba la cena . And if you wanted to show that it was he that was burning the dinner, \\nhow would you do that?  \\nS: Just él. Él quemaba la cena .  \\nT: Good. And if you wanted to show that it was you (formal), You were burning the dinner :S: Usted quemaba la cena .  \\nT: Good. Usted quemaba la cena . Good. So Él quemaba la cena , he was burning , and then we say \\nwhat he was burning : the dinner . If we want to say The dinner was burning , The dinner was getting \\nburnt , we can’t just say La cena quemaba , because we are waiting to hea r what was the dinner \\nburning? It feels incomplete. So if you want to just say The dinner was burning , like The dinner \\nwas getting burnt , in Spanish we are going to say The dinner was burning itself . What is itself ?  \\nS: Se.  \\nT: Se. So how would you say The dinner was burning , The dinner was getting burnt , The dinner was \\nburning itself ?  \\nS: La cena se quemaba .  \\nT: Very good. That’s it! La cena se quemaba . Good. The position of la cena  is also flexible. You \\ncan say La cena se quemaba  or you can put la cena  afterwards. How would that be?  \\nS: Se quemaba la cena .  \\nT: Se quemaba la cena . So it’s flexible, unlike in English, because in English, well we don’t really \\nchange verbs so much. There are not so many grammatical resources in English as there are in \\nSpanish, for example, so in English the word order is much more important than in Spanish to \\nshow what’s going on. So we can say La cena se quemaba  or Se quemaba la cena . Because we \\nhave se, we understand that the dinner was getting burnt, there was nobody el se there involved. If \\nyou want to say I burn , like in the sun, in the sense of, you know, I get burnt , you’re also going to \\nuse this structure, no? You’re going to say I burn myself in the sun . Now you understand you’re \\nnot burning yourself, it just means I get burnt . So sun is sol. In was:  \\nS: En.  \\nT: En. So I get burnt , I burn in the sun , how would that be? And sun is masculine.  \\nS: Me quemo en el sol .  \\nT: Good. Me quemo en el sol . You can’t just say Quemo en el sol , because this would mean that I \\nburn so mething in the sun , and we will be waiting to hear what you burn in the sun. Me quemo \\nen el sol . If you want to say The sun burns me , this is another way you could put the sentence, andthere we are not using this “self” structure, because we have The sun burns  and then we have me \\ntelling us what it burns, so it’s complete. So how would you say that, the sun burns me ?  \\nS: El sol me quema .  \\nT: Good. El sol me quema . Me quema el sol . Either way. Another example of a verb like this is \\nromper . Romper . Romper  means – maybe you can guess it. What do you think romper  means?  \\nIt’s quite obscure, the connection, but you might find it. Rupture ?  \\nS: To break.   \\nT: To break . Romper , to break . So how would you say I break ?  \\nS: Rompo .  \\nT: Rompo , with a p, rompo . I brea k it:  \\nS: Lo rompo .  \\nT: Lo rompo . Good. I break it . If you want to say it breaks , like it gets broken , it breaks all the time . \\nAll the time  is todo el tiempo . Literally all, todo , el tiempo , the time . Todo , t-o-d-o, is all. So It \\nbreaks all the time , It breaks itself , it gets broken , all the time . How would you say that? It breaks \\nall the time :  \\nS: Se rompa todo  –  \\nT: The se got your attention, so you forgot to do something very important, which was to quickly go \\nback to the “to” form and be clear on what t ype of verb you’re working with.  \\nS: Se rompe todo el tiempo .  \\nT: Good. Se rompe todo el tiempo . It breaks all the time . So here we understand that it gets broken, \\nit breaks itself . How would you say they break all the time ?  \\nS: It’s rompen . And, Se romp en todo el tiempo .  \\nT: Se rompen todo el tiempo . They break themselves , not literally that they are breaking themselves, \\njust they get broken . We don’t have this get in Spanish, and this is how we get around it.  \\nWhat was tonight ?S: Esta noche .  \\nT: Esta noche . So we said esta is this for feminine words. Esta noche . What was this for masculine \\nwords? How did we say this car ?  \\nS: Este auto .  \\nT: Este auto. Este coche . Good. So este is this for masculine words. And we have the /e/ of el, like \\nel auto , in este. Este auto . These cars  are estos autos . So we go from este to estos  for the plural.  \\nNot estes . Ah? Estos . Estos autos .  \\nS: Estos autos .  \\nT: Now this might look irregular, but there is a logic there, it’s just different to the one that we might \\nexpect. We  have the /e/ of el in este, and we have the /os/ of los in estos . So we have the car :  \\nS: El coche .  \\nT: Good. And this car :  \\nS: Este coche.   \\nT: Good. The car s:  \\nS: Los coches .  \\nT: Los coches . And these cars :  \\nS: Estos coches .  \\nT: Estos coches . So we have /os/ in los and estos , and we have /e/ in el and este. All of those you can \\nmake that and those  now, just by plucking out the t. So if este auto  is this car , how do you say \\nthat car ?  \\nS: Ese auto .  \\nT: Ese auto . If estos  coches  or estos  autos  are these cars , how would you say those cars ?  \\nS: Esos autos .T: Esos autos . Good. So how would you say those ones  and for those ones  you can just use this word \\nfor those  and imagine me talking about masculine things or mixed things, things of mixed gender. \\nThose ones break all the time, those ones break all the time :  \\nS: Esos rompen todo el tiempo .  \\nT: So now I’m waiting to hear what they break. Esos rompen todo el tiempo .  \\nS: Ah.  \\nT: What do they break all the time?  \\nS: Esos se rompen todo el tiempo .  \\nT: Good. Esos se rompen todo el tiempo . So you will have to listen out in Spanish for these verbs \\nthat want you to show it when their action isn’t to something else. It’s transforming , not something \\nelse, se transforma . It breaks , it’s breaking , not something else, se rompe . It’s changing , not \\nsomething else, but here you don’t need it. Cambia , from cambiar . Cambia . Being aware that \\nthis occurs is enough, and we will listen out and in real life get a conscious understanding and also \\nan intuition about where we n eed to do this.\",\n",
       " \"Track 48  \\nT: We said that for -ar verbs, we take away the -ar and we put -aba to get this line in the past. So \\ncenar , to dine or to have dinner . Cenaba , I was having dinner, I was dining, I used to have dinner, \\nI used to dine . Now for  -er/-ir verbs, we take away our -er/-ir ending and we put -ía. Where did \\nwe hear that before? -ía?  \\nS: The “would” tense.  \\nT: Comer  was to eat . How was I would eat ?  \\nS: Comería .  \\nT: Comería . Good. Now for the line in the past, we are not adding on to the  full verb. We are taking \\noff our ending before we put -ía. So how would it be? I was eating, he was eating, she was eating , \\netc.?  \\nS: Comía .  \\nT: Comía . Vender  is to sell . Vender . I would sell it. I would sell it :  \\nS: Lo vendería .  \\nT: Lo vendería . I was selling it. I was selling it:   \\nS: Lo vendía .  \\nT: Lo vendía . Good. If you want to say for sale , you can just say it sells itself. It sells itself. It’s for \\nsale. How would that be?  \\nS: Se vende .  \\nT: Se vende . Good. For sale.  Se vende . It sells itself. And i f you go to a Spanish speaking place, you \\nwill see on houses and on cars this expression. Se vende . It was selling itself, it was for sale :  \\nS: Se vendía .  \\nT: Se vendía . It would be for sale. It would sell itself :  \\nS: Se vendería .T: Se vendería . It would  sell itself. It would be for sale.  Good. What was to break  again? Related to \\nrupture ?  \\nS: Romper .  \\nT: Romper . Good. How would you say I was breaking it ?  \\nS: Lo rompía .  \\nT: Lo rompía . Good. And if you just wanted to say it was breaking , and you mean by i tself. It was \\nbreaking , not something else. How would you say it?  \\nS: Se rompía .  \\nT: Se rompía . Good. How would you say they were breaking ?  \\nS: Se rompían .  \\nT: Se rompían . Good. Give me again the “to” form. To break :  \\nS: Romper .  \\nT: Romper . What is I wou ld break it ? I would break it :  \\nS: Lo rompía . Ah, lo rompería .  \\nT: Lo rompería . I would break it . How would you say I was breaking it ?  \\nS: Lo rompía .  \\nT: Lo rompía . Good. How would you say they would break it ? They would break it :  \\nS: Les?  \\nT: They would break  is where you need to begin.  \\nS: Romperían . Lo romperían .  \\nT: Lo romperían . They were breaking it, they were breaking it :  \\nS: Lo rompían .T: Lo rompían . So, we have the same endings for would  and for the line in the past for -er/-ir verbs . \\nThe big difference of course is that for would  we are adding on to the “to” form of the verb and \\nfor the past we are taking off our endings first, which means we get pairs like comería , I would \\neat; comía , I was eating . Rompería , I would break ; rompía , I was breaking . So how would you \\nsay it breaks , it breaks, and you mean it gets broken ? It breaks itself in the present tense:  \\nS: Se rompe .  \\nT: Se rompe . How would you say it’s going to break ? It’s going to break . How is we are g oing or \\nlet’s go ?  \\nS: Vamos .  \\nT: It is going to break.   \\nS: Se va a romper .  \\nT: Good. Se va a romper or va a romperse . So this means it’s going to break . It’s going to get \\nbroken and there we are not waiting to hear what it’s going to break because we hav e se. So we \\ncompleted that structure. We completed the sentence with se. The word for how in Spanish is \\ncómo.  If you want to ask somebody in Spanish, how do you say ? - so maybe you have a Spanish \\nspeaking friend that speaks English. And you want to use the m like a dictionary and say how do \\nyou say x, y, or z ? What you will say in Spanish is how does it say itself?  How is it said? How does \\nit say itself? So this is another example of where you might be using this structure of self, which \\nwe are seeing in S panish is very flexible. It’s giving us many different meanings, this structure of \\nmyself, yourself, ourselves, itself, this structure. So it says  from decir  is dice. It's a little bit \\nirregular, but then the other versions follow. So we have dice for he, she, it , or usted .  \\nHow would you say, you (informal) say?  \\nS: Dices .  \\nT: Good. And they:  \\nS: Dicen .  \\nT: Dicen . And as we know the we form tends to escape the irregularity as the accent is somewhere \\nelse, so we go back to decir . And to say we say :S: Decimos .  \\nT: Decimos . Good. So how would you say, how is it said? How does it say itself? :  \\nS: ¿Cómo se dice ?  \\nT: ¿Cómo se dice ? So you will use this often. You don’t say “¿cómo dices?” This means how do you, \\nas an individual, say... how do you say it? If you want to say, how is it said , ¿Cómo se dice?  How \\ndoes it say itself?  \\nSo se is doing quite a lot in Spanish. Sometimes we are using it to wrap up the sentence, to show \\nthat we are not using a verb “to” anybody or “to” anything else like in it breaks , or it transforms , \\nthese examples that we saw. Sometimes the se is changing the meaning like between quedar , \\nremain , or be leftover and quedarse , to stay . And sometimes this se has quite a creative \\napplication. Se vende . It sells itself , for sale . Or, we c ould even have se habla . Se habla español . \\nSpanish speaks itself. Spanish is spoken. Spanish spoken . Se habla español . Quedar  by itself \\nmeans to remain . And you can use this in the sense of  I have one left . In Spanish, you will say  it \\nremains to me one . This is the structure in Spanish.  I have one left . It remains to me one . So how \\nwould you say that?  I have one left . What is the word for one?  \\nS: Uno.  \\nT: Uno, or una if you are talking about a feminine thing. So I have one left, it remains to me one :  \\nS: Me quedo  un.  \\nT: That means I stay one.  So there you made the reflexive structure. You said  I remain myself and \\nyou got the meaning of  to stay . But what you want is it remains to me .  \\nS: Me queda un .  \\nT: Me queda uno . I have one left . Me queda uno . I have t wo left . If me queda uno is it remains to \\nme one , I have one left . How do you think you would say I have two left ? The word for two is dos. \\nDos.  \\nS: Dos.  \\nT: Related to duo. So I have two left. They remain to me two :S: Me quedan dos .  \\nT: Me quedan dos . Very good. And of course we have the they form of the verb because it’s they \\nremain . As I’m saying they remain to me, to me , how do you think it would be if you wanted to \\nsay he has two left ?  \\nS: Le quedan dos .  \\nT: Le quedan dos . Two of the m, they remain to him . Le quedan dos . He has two left or she has two \\nleft, or you (formal ) have two left . So maybe if you go to a shop and you ask for something and \\nthere’s none left, maybe they will say no me quedan . I don’t have any left . No me quedan, n o \\nme queda , you will hear both just depending on what the person has in their mind. I have none \\nleft as in one. I have none left as in they’ve all gone . No me queda . No me quedan . But, we saw \\nthat with this verb then when we use this reflexive structure, this “self” structure, we get a different \\nmeaning. If I say  I remain myself then I get the meaning of to stay . I stay . So how is I remain \\nmyself ?  \\nS: Me quedo .  \\nT: Good. Me quedo . We remain ourselves :  \\nS: Nos quedamos .  \\nT: Nos quedamos . Good. He remains himself or she remains herself :  \\nS: Se queda .  \\nT: Se queda . They stay :  \\nS: Se quedan .  \\nT: Se quedan . Good. Ah, It’s all of those that begin with l - lo, la, los, las , all become se for the “self ” \\nversion. From hablar , to speak , if you want to say I was s peaking, he was speaking :  \\nS: Hablaba .  \\nT: Hablaba . So we have -aba as our key sound for the line in the past for -ar verbs. They were \\nspeaking :  \\nS: Hablaban .T: Good. So how do you say they were staying, they were remaining themselves ?  \\nS: Se quedaban .  \\nT: Se quedaban . Good. They weren’t staying here :  \\nS: No se quedaban aquí .  \\nT: Good. I wasn’t staying here :  \\nS: No me quedabo , no-  \\nT: So -aba works for I, he, she, it , and you formal.  \\nS: No me quedaba .  \\nT: No me quedaba aquí. And we were staying he re:  \\nS: Nos quedabamos aquí.   \\nT: The accent stays.  \\nS: Quedábamos .  \\nT: Nos quedábamos aquí . We weren’t staying here :  \\nS: No nos quedábamos aquí.   \\nT: No nos quedábamos aquí . Good. Now if you wanted to say we didn’t have any left , so here, what \\nwe will s ay is it didn’t , or they didn’t , we have the option, remain to us .  \\nS: No nos quedaban .  \\nT: Good. No nos quedaba or no nos quedaban . Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 49  \\nT: To call  in Spanish, so to call to somebody and also to make a phone call is llamar .  \\nS: Llamar .  \\nT: L-l, and we said this double l creates a / yuh/ sound in most Spanish dialects just like the y. L-l-a-\\nm-a-r. Llamar .  \\nS: Llamar .  \\nT: Good. And we said that in Spanish you don’t tend to say my name is or I am called , you say I call \\nmyself to introduce y ourself. So how would you say I call myself ?  \\nS: Me llamo .  \\nT: Me llamo . Good. And if you want  to ask somebody what their name is, you could say how do you \\ncall yourself?  So let’s do this informally. How do you call yourself?  What was the word for how?  \\nS: Cómo .  \\nT: Cómo . How do you call yourself? :  \\nS: ¿Cómo te llamas ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Cómo te llamas ? How would you say how does she call herself? What is her name? :  \\nS: ¿Cómo se llama ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Cómo se llama ? Imagine you heard her name once before and you wan ted to say what \\nwas she called? How was she calling herself? :  \\nS: ¿Cómo se llamaba ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Cómo se llamaba ? What was her name, what was his name, or what was your name \\n(formally) ? What was their name, what were they calling themselves?:   \\nS: ¿Cómo se ll amaban ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Cómo se llamaban ? Good. What was to have , not in the sense of haber , not the have  that \\nwe use to go into the past, but the have  that we used for possession?S: Tener .  \\nTener . Good. And we said also that this tener  is the -tain, -tain that we get inside various English \\nverbs or Latin -English verbs like contain . Contain  is contener . So we have this trick using tener  \\nthat we can convert over some more verbs from English. So doing the same with obtain , we would \\nget:  \\nS: Obtener .  \\nT: Obtener . Maintain  changed a little bit. Have a go:  \\nS: Mentener .  \\nT: Mantener .  \\nS: Mantener .  \\nT: Mantener . And we said that man- actually is like from mano, hand. Sustain . And this one changed \\na little bit as well.  \\nS: Sostener .  \\nT: Sostener . So this -tain that we have in English is tener . To have . So how would you say I used to \\nhave ?  \\nS: Tenía .  \\nT: Tenía . Good. So if you wanted to say I used to have a big house :  \\nS: Tenía un grande casa . Un casa grande .  \\nT: Yeah, almost, but un?  \\nS: Una. Una casa grande.   \\nT: Good. These bits and pieces require a little thought as well. Tenía una casa grande . We used to \\nhave a big house :  \\nS: Teníamos una grande - una casa grande .T: Good. Teníamos una casa grande . And the accent stays in the same place on the -ía. Tenía , \\nteníamos . Good. I used to have four, but now I don’t have any left . I used to have four, but now I \\ndon’t have any left: the word for four is cuatro, cuatro .  \\nS: Cuatro .  \\nT: Related to:  \\nS: Quarter .  \\nT: Very good. So I used to have four :  \\nS: Tenía cuatro .  \\nT: Good. But now :  \\nS: Pero ahora.  \\nT: I don’t have any left. So they don’t remain me , or it doesn’t remain to me . That’s all we need to \\nsay to give that I don’t have any left:   \\nS: No me queda .  \\nT: Good. So all together. I used to have four, but now I don’t h ave any left :  \\nS: Tenía cuatro, pero ahora no me queda .  \\nT: Good. Tenía cuatro, pero ahora no me queda or pero ahora, no me quedan . You could use \\neither. So, we are not using have  to give this meaning we have left . How was I have  in the present?  \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo . And how did you make that I have to ? I have to in the sense of I must :  \\nS: Que. Tengo que .  \\nT: So I have to see you , and let’s speak informally?  \\nS: Tengo que verte .  \\nT: Good. Tengo que verte . Now if you want to say I had to see you , you can use this line in the past \\nthat we learned even though in English we are saying had, not having to , this is fine in Spanish.So I had to see you, I was having to see you :  \\nS: Tenía que verte .  \\nT: Good. Tenía que verte . Good. Yesterday is ayer, a-y-e-r. Ayer.  \\nS: Ayer .  \\nT: Good. So I had to see you yesterday :  \\nS: Tenía que verte ayer.   \\nT: Good. Tenía que verte ayer . To do or to make was hacer . H-a-c-e-r. Hacer .  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: Did you have to do it yesterday?  Talking informally, did you have to do it yesterda y?:  \\nS: ¿Tenías que hacerlo ayer ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Tenías que hacerlo ayer ? Didn’t you have to do it yesterday? :  \\nS: ¿No tenías que hacerlo ayer ?  \\nT: Good. And you could use this like weren’t you supposed to do it?  ¿No tenías que hacerlo ayer ? \\nDidn’t you have to  do it yesterday? Weren’t you supposed to do it yesterday? Good. I want to look \\nat just three irregular verbs that we have for this line in the past. Now this is a very regular tense. \\nThere are very few irregularities in this tense. It’s a very safe tense and the irregularities that we \\nhave are with very small verbs. For example, ver. How was I see, from ver?  \\nS: Veo.  \\nT: Veo. The same irregularity that we get in the I form in the present, veo; we get it in this line in the \\npast. So instead of taking off -er and putting -o, we ended up with this extra e. So veía is I was \\nseeing , I used to see , he was seeing , he used to see , she was seeing , she used to see , or you (formal). \\nVeía . Give me the other versions then. We were seeing :  \\nS: Veíamos .  \\nT: Veíamos . They  or you guys :S: Veían .  \\nT: Veían . You (informal):  \\nS: Veías .  \\nT: Good. Another irregular verb in this tense is ser. Ser. To be.  Now the base for I, he, she, it, you \\n(formal) is era, era. Now this is very easy to remember because we are looking at the past  which \\nis a line in time and then era in English is a line in time in the past. So we can just think of an era. \\nWe would use this with characteristic things. So for example, if you wanted to say  I used to be a \\nstudent , what was student ?  \\nS: Estudiante .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I used to be a student ?  \\nS: Era estudiante .  \\nT: Era estudiante . Good. We don’t need the word for a. Era estudiante. Good. Were you a student , \\ninformally ?  \\nS: ¿Eras estudiante ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Eras estudiante ? We were students .  \\nS: Eramos, eramos -  \\nT: Where are you putting the accent? I couldn’t tell.  \\nS: I put it at the -a, at the -AMos , but it’s ERamos .  \\nT: Éramos . Good. In these tenses the accent doesn’t move around. Good, so era, éramos . Good. We \\nwere students :  \\nS: Éramos estudiantes .  \\nT: Good. What were they? What were they? :  \\nS: ¿Qué eran ?T: Yeah, ¿Qué eran?  Good. And then the last one of course, that is irregular in this tense is ir. Ir. To \\ngo. Now I was going is kind of like a blend of the two different ways we have of creating this past : \\n-aba and -ía. I was going  is iba. So you see we get a bit of -ía and a bit of -aba with ir. I was going \\nfrom to go . Iba. So you can give me the other versions . We were going :  \\nS: Íbamos .  \\nT: Good. They were  going :  \\nS: Iban .  \\nT: Good. You were going , informally:  \\nS: Ibas.  \\nT: Ibas. Good. Why were you going? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué ibas ?  \\nT: Good. Now iba is very useful because, of course, you can use it like in the English  I was going to \\ncall you , for example. I was go ing to go, but I didn’t have the time. I was going to do it, but I \\nforgot. So you can use it in this way as well, which is very common. So how would you say I was \\ngoing to call you , and we are talking informally? I was going to call you :  \\nS: Iba llamarte .  \\nT: There is something missing. Iba llamarte .  \\nS: Iba. I was . I was going .  \\nT: Hmm, what kind of verb is going ?  \\nS: Iba a llamarte.   \\nT: Good. Iba a llamarte . I was going to do it :  \\nS: Iba hacerlo .  \\nT: Good. And I’m not sure here if you are putting the a to connect the verbs.  \\nS: If I did it?T: Yeah.  \\nS: No, I didn’t. I forgot.  \\nT: Ok, so again.  \\nS: Iba a hacerlo .  \\nT: Good. Iba a hacerlo . So actually in fluent speech you would hear / ibacerlo /. All of those three \\n/a/’s, iba, a, hacer  would blend toget her, so that’s why I wasn’t sure if you said it or not. We were \\ngoing to do it or make it :  \\nS: Íbamos a hacerlo .  \\nT: Good. Íbamos a hacerlo . We were going to do them or we were going to make them :  \\nS: Íbamos a hacerlos .  \\nT: Good. Íbamos a hacerlos . Good .',\n",
       " 'Track 50  \\nT: Gracias por venir . Gracias por venir  in Spanish means thanks for coming . Gracias por venir .  \\nS: Gracias por venir .  \\nT: So there’s two things that we can see in this sentence. We can use this sentence like a hook t o \\nremember two important things about Spanish. The first thing is that we have two words for for.  \\nWe already saw another word for for. For example, how were we saying for me ?  \\nS: Para mí.  \\nT: Para mí. Good. And for you , speaking informally:  \\nS: Para  ti.  \\nT: Para ti.  So we had mí and ti coming with prepositions. Para mí, para ti, de mí, from me, de ti , \\nfrom you , but then for the other people we just say for he , for example. So how is for him or for he \\nin Spanish?  \\nS: Para él.  \\nT: Good. And for her:  \\nS: Para ella.   \\nT: Good. So this para  is when something is for somebody. No? For example, if you want to say this \\nis for you , speaking informally, let’s say it’s a masculine object. This, this one, is for you . How \\nwould you say that?  \\nS: Ello-  \\nT: Wha t is tonight ?  \\nS: Ah, esta.  \\nT: Good. So that’s your hook and you go from there. Esta noche . But, I want a masculine thing.  \\nS: Esto -  \\nT: What you should do is look at somewhere that you’ve used it. So you should look at this car .S: Este.  \\nT: And then yo u find it. These are the processes that we’re learning and this is half of the method. \\nYou can take yourself through those processes when you need to find it. Then it comes to your \\nmemory. Then you know it after that. But, the first few times, you need to have a look around, \\nlet’s say, and seek to find it. So this or this one , masculine thing:  \\nS: Este.  \\nT: Este. So this one is for you  (speaking informally ):  \\nS: Este es para ti .  \\nT: Good. Este es para ti  if we mean a masculine thing. What if you meant these are for you  \\n(masculine or mixed things )?  \\nS: Estos son para ti.   \\nT: Well done. Estos son para ti.  So we saw that actually for this and these  we have este and estos . \\nIn este we have the /e/ of el and in estos  we have the /os/ of los. Estos son para  ti. So this is the \\nfor that we learned until now, no? Then we have por which is much more flexible. It has many \\nmore meanings. Let’s investigate some of them. Por. You can use it like because of . No? \\nSometimes when we say for in English, we me an because of . For example, if you say for this \\nreason . What you mean is because of this reason . So you don’t mean para , you mean por. So por \\nalso means for in the sense of because of . And actually in the words because  and why, which were?  \\nS: Por qué?   \\nT: Por qué . Here in why, we see that it is because of . Por qué , why, actually means because of what . \\nBecause of what?  And then porque  as because . We said that we have the same word for why and \\nbecause . Porque  as because  means because of that . So in both case s you have por, meaning \\nbecause of . So reason  in Spanish is razón . Razón .  \\nS: Razón .  \\nT: Or / rathón / in most of Spain. / Rathón /. But in most of the Spanish speaking world / rasón /.  \\nS: Razón .T: Razón  is feminine. So how would you say this reason ?  \\nS: Esta razón .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say because of this reason, I don’t want to go ? Because of this reason, I \\ndon’t want to go :  \\nS: Por esta razón, no quiero ir.   \\nT: Por esta razón, no quiero ir . Let’s contrast the two. What was to buy ? Do you rem ember to buy ?  \\nS: Comprer - comprer - comprar ?  \\nT: Comprar . Good. Comprar . You can say I’m buying it for you.  How would you say that? Let’s \\nkeep it informal. I’m buying it for you :  \\nS: Lo compro para ti.  \\nT: Good. Lo compro para ti.  That means, you know, this thing I’m buying it for you . But maybe, in \\nsome contexts you want to say I’m buying it because of you . How would you say that?  \\nS: Lo compro por ti.  \\nT: Good. Lo compro por ti . So it doesn’t mean necessarily that this thing is for that person, just that \\nyou’ve bought it because of that person. So maybe you buy an ashtray in your house and your one \\nfriend that smokes comes and you say lo he comprado por ti . I have bought it because of you . If \\nyou say  lo he comprado para ti , for you , then he’ll run to take the ashtray home. Another use for \\npor is when we’re talking about time. When you are talking about periods of time, for two weeks , \\nfor two days , you will not say para . You will say por. This is another place where you use por. \\nThe word for day is día. Día.  \\nS: Día.  \\nT: Día. It’s actually related to an Indo -European root which just means a very old root meaning light. \\nAnd deity  in English comes from the same root. Or the ju- of Jupiter  is actually also from this root. \\nJupiter  means something l ike the father of the gods. You have -piter  like paternal  there and ju- \\nfrom this same root as día and deity . And of course you have Jupiter which is the biggest planet,so the father of the gods, Jupiter. Día is a word that looks feminine and i t’s one of those few words \\nthat end in -a, that look feminine, but are masculine. So the day  is:  \\nS: El día.  \\nT: El día. And the days :  \\nS: Los días.  \\nT: Los días . And every day  is all the days . Before we said todo el tiempo  to say all the time . If yo u \\nwant to say every  day, you say all the days . How do you think that would sound?  \\nS: Todos los días.  \\nT: Good. Todos  in plural. Todos los días . Good. If you wanted to say I’m staying for three days , \\nthree is tres. Tres . I’m staying for three days, I remai n myself for three days , so how would you \\nsay that? I’m staying for three days :  \\nS: Me quedo por tres días.  \\nT: Very good. Me quedo por tres días . I’m staying for three days . How would you say I will stay for \\nthree days,  I will stay for three days . You don ’t really need - you don’t need the will here. The fact \\nthat you say for three days is already some kind of a future context. The days didn’t happen yet, \\nbut let’s practice the future. So I will stay for three days :  \\nS: So it’s quedé?  \\nT: In both futures, w e are adding on to the verb -  \\nS: Quedaré .  \\nT: Yes, we are pushing it into the future. So I will stay for three days :  \\nS: Me quedaré por tres días.  \\nT: Good. Me quedaré por tres días . So this sounds a little bit more certain, you know, when you use \\nthe futu re. Me quedo por tres días.  I’m staying for three days . Me quedaré por tres días . I will \\nstay for three days . How would you say I would stay for three days ? I would stay for three days . \\nA nice hook to remember would  is I would like or it would please me . This is a nice hook.S: Me gustaría.  \\nT: So this is a nice hook to remember would , because it is something that is very common that you \\nwill use a lot. So what is that little bit you need for would  that you can pluck out of me gustaría ?  \\nS: The -ía ending.  \\nT: Perfect. So I would stay for three days :  \\nS: Me quedaría por tres días.  \\nT: Good. Me quedaría por tres días . But, I have to work.  Do you remember what is to work ? We \\nsaw it very briefly?  \\nS: Trabajar .  \\nT: Trabajar . Good. Trabajar  is t-r-a-b-a-j-a-r and that -jar makes / har/. Trabajar . So, but I have \\nto work :  \\nS: Pero tengo que trabajar.  \\nT: Yes, now all together. I would stay for three days, but I have to work.  And not from memory, but \\nthinking it through.  \\nS: I know because I’ve already forgott en it.  \\nT: Good. So, thinking it through again. Taking that time to think it through again. I would stay is the \\nfirst bit:  \\nS: Me quedaría.  \\nT: Good. For three days :  \\nS: Por tres días.  \\nT: But, I have to work :  \\nS: Pero tengo que trabajar.   \\nT: Perfect . Me quedaría por tres días , pero tengo que trabajar. Perfect. Very good .',\n",
       " \"Track 51  \\nT: What was I am, from estar ? I am:  \\nS: Estoy .  \\nT: Estoy . If you want to say I’m there for you , I’m there for you , you know, in this supportive way, \\nyou don’t have to say there  to begin with. Because we are using estar  and not ser, it kind of makes \\nthat there  a little redundant. We feel that already in estar  that’s referring to states, locations and \\nstates, so we don’t need to say there . We can just say I’m for you, I’m for  you, using estar . What \\nfor do you think you need?  \\nS: Para .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I’m there for you , talking to a friend?  \\nS: Estoy para ti.  \\nT: Estoy para ti . Good. To say I’m here because of you , then we are not going to use para . We don’t \\neven really need to say here.  \\nS: If it’s still estoy  it still implies location.  \\nT: It kind of just gives you the feeling. Actually, when you knock on somebody’s door and you are \\ncalling for them, you will just say ¿Estás?  You don’t say Are you there?  Or if you’re on internet, \\n¿Estás?  you will write in the messenger. If you call somebody up and you want to speak to Juan, \\nyou will not say Is Juan there?  You will just say ¿Está Juan? ¿Juan está?  So, I am here because \\nof you  (formal):  \\nS: Estoy por usted.  \\nT: Good. Estoy por usted . For you  (informal):  \\nS: Estoy por ti.  \\nT: Estoy por ti . So this would be because of you . How would you say I have come because of you, I \\nhave come because of you ( informal ). I have come because of you :  \\nS: Ah, the first bit  is he. He venido por ti.T: He venido por ti . So whenever we want because of , we want to avoid the temptation to translate \\nporque de , because of . Good. So I have come because of you , he venido por ti . You could also \\nsay It is because of you that we have come , for example. It is because of you that we have come.  \\nAnd of course we can make this sentence perfectly if we think it through piece by piece. So, it is \\nbecause of you :  \\nS: Es por ti.  \\nT: That we have come :  \\nS: Que hemos venido.  \\nT: Good. Es por ti qu e hemos venido . It is because of you that we have come.  Good. Another use of \\npor – so we are seeing that por is much more flexible than para  – another use of por is if you \\nwant to say for in the sense of exchanging this one for that one, to exchange someth ing for \\nsomething else, then also we use por. Cambiar , cambiar , means to change . If you want to say, I \\nwould change this one for that one , I would change this one for that one, and with this one  and \\nthat one  let’s refer to a masculine thing. So, I would ch ange  is the first step.  \\nS: Cambiaría ?  \\nT: Uh -huh. This one , a masculine thing:  \\nS: Este.  \\nT: Good. For that one , masculine thing.  \\nS: Por ese.  \\nT: Good. Take away the t. Good. Cambiaría este por ese . I would change this one for that one.  How \\nwould you say  I would change these ones for those ones , masculine or mixed objects? I would \\nchange these ones for those ones:   \\nS: Cambiaría estos por esos.  \\nT: Good. Cambiaría estos por esos . Very good. What if they were feminine things?  \\nS: Cambiaría estas por esas.T: Good. Cambiaría estas por esas . Good. Would you change these ones for those ones?  Speaking \\ninformally. Would you change these ones for those ones? , still feminine things:  \\nS: ¿Cambiarías estas por esas?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Cambiarías estas por esas ? Wouldn’t yo u change these ones for those ones? , still \\nfeminine:  \\nS: ¿No cambiarías estas por esas?  \\nT: Good. Go on…   \\nS: ¿Por qué no cambiaría estas por esas ?   \\nT: Still think it through though.  \\nS: Sorry, ¿ Por qué no cambiarías estas por esas ?  \\nT: Good. We don’t wan t to stop thinking. You will be able to relax that as you go on, but at the \\nbeginning you want to be very insistent on your thinking  so you install correct structural habits or \\ngrammatical habits. We don’t really use much grammatical terminology, but e verything we’re \\nseeing here is grammar, of course. It’s all structure. Ah, something I should mention is that if \\nyou’re chatting online, if you’re practicing your Spanish online you might see por written as an x \\nas a shortcut. Because por is also what you use in, like, times tables. Ocho por ocho  is eight times \\neight . So you might see gracias por venir as gracias x venir . And if you have the habit of writing \\nkisses with an x this can be very confusing to Spanish speakers. So gracias por venir  reminds us, \\nthis nice hook, that we will hear a lot, gracias por venir , reminds us that we have two words for \\nfor. Para,  something being for you , quite literally, and then por, which is much more flexible in \\nmeaning. The other thing that we learn from the sentence graci as por venir  is that after \\nprepositions, so these little group of words, we’ve seen - para , por, de, en, con, a, we’ve seen \\nquite a few of them - following these words in English we put -ing. Thank you for coming.  But in \\nSpanish we just put the “to” form. Gracias por venir. So how would you say thank you for calling , \\nthank you for calling  - if you forget call you can think of what’s your name?  or how are you called?  \\nbecause it’s something that people tend to have heard somewhere.  \\nS: Gracias por llamar.T: Good. Gracias por llamar . And if you wanted to say thanks for calling me  you could say that as \\nwell.  \\nS: Gracias por llamarme.  \\nT: Good. Gracias por llamarme . So after prepositions we don’t use the -ing. We want to resist any \\ntemptation to put the -ing form after the preposition. This is negative language transfer, things that \\nare not the same between English and Spanish. What was I am from estar ?  \\nS: Estoy .  \\nT: Estoy . And you remember how to say tired  in Spanish?  \\nS: Cansado .  \\nT: Good. Cansado . So how do you say I am tired ?  \\nS: Estoy cansado.  \\nT: But you being a female?  \\nS: Cansada .  \\nT: Good. Estoy cansada . So if you want to say I’m tired of  – dancing , cooking , cleaning  – it’s all \\ngoing to be with the “to” form. What was to work ?  \\nS: Trabajar .  \\nT: Trab ajar. How would you say I’m tired of working ?  \\nS: Estoy cansada de trabajar.  \\nT: Yes. Estoy cansada de trabajar.  Good. For one of the pasts that we saw, for the line in the past, \\nso when we’re referring to like a period of time in the past, for –ar verbs  we have the -aba base \\nending. So how would you say I was  from estar ?  \\nS: Estaba .  \\nT: Estaba . I was tired of working :  \\nS: Estaba cansada de trabajar.T: Estaba cansada de trabajar . Good. I was tired of working.  Good. We were tired of working , and \\nlet’s be a masculine or a mixed group. We were tired of working :  \\nS: Estábamos cansados de trabajar.  \\nT: Very good. Estábamos cansados de trabajar.  Good. If you want to say something like it’s a way \\nof doing it , it’s a way of doing it,  the word for way is form , a form of doing it , and how do you \\nthink form  might be in Spanish if you had to guess it?  \\nS: Forma .  \\nT: Yes. Forma . Good. So how would you say a way of doing it ? What was to do  or to make ?  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: It is a way of doing it :  \\nS: Es una forma de hacerlo.  \\nT: Good. Es una forma de hacerlo . Good. I don’t believe in arguing like this , in this way . I don’t \\nbelieve in arguing in this way.  So, to believe  is creer , creer  and it has two e's, c-r-e-e-r, creer.   \\nS: Creer .  \\nT: So how do you say I don’t be lieve ?  \\nS: No creo.  \\nT: No creo . What was creation ?  \\nS: Creación .  \\nT: And what was to create ?  \\nS: Crear .  \\nT: And what was I create ?  \\nS: Creo .T: Yes. So we get this situation occasionally in Spanish that the “ I” form of two different verbs will \\nlook the same. Creo , of course, could be from creer , to believe , or from crear , to create . So, I \\ndon’t believe :  \\nS: No creo.  \\nT: In arguing . So to argue  in Spanish you can use to discuss . This is the most common verb, actually, \\nthat’s used for argue . Discuss  is discutir , discutir .  \\nS: So what do they use for discuss ?  \\nT: Hablar , mostly, but you can use discutir  as well for discuss , but it has a heavy connotation mostly. \\nNo? I mean, if you argue with your boyfriend or your girlfriend you use discutir , you say this. \\nArgüir , which is argue , means to argue a point, rather than to get in an argument. Discutir  is more \\nlike to get in an argument. So it’s what we can call a false friend, words that look like they are the \\nsame, but they have a difference in meaning,  and there are a few of them. We need to watch out \\nfor them between English and Spanish. Another example would be actual , which doesn’t mean \\nactual , it means current , no? Mi trabajo actual , my current job . Actualmente  means currently , \\nat the moment , rather  than actually . Mostly the vocabulary, the Latin English that we turn into \\nSpanish , is very reliable, but there are a few words that we want to watch out for. Discutir  is one \\nof them. This doesn’t really mean to discuss  as much as it does to argue . So, I don’t believe in \\narguing :  \\nS: No creo en discutir.  \\nT: Good. In this way , we will say of this way  rather than in this way .  \\nS: De esta forma.  \\nT: Good. So all together, I don’t believe in arguing , in discussing , in this way :  \\nS: No creo en discutir de esta forma.  \\nT: Good. No creo en discutir de esta forma . Good. So with this sentence, gracias por venir , we are \\nreminded how we have two words for for, por and para , and we need to have a think and decide \\nwhich one we think is most appropriate before we transla te for. And that after prepositions we \\ndon’t need to worry about making the -ing form of the verb, we just use the “to” form.\",\n",
       " \"Track 52  \\nT: Para , this for, para , can also mean in order to,  in order to . So in a sentence, for example, We have \\nspoken in order  to resolve it . We have spoken in order to resolve it. Now in English we could just \\nsay We have spoken to resolve it , no? We don’t need to say in order to . But whenever we have this \\nto meaning in order to , we want to translate this as para  in Spanish. So l et’s make this sentence. \\nFirst bit is We have spoken. We have spoken :  \\nS: Hemos hablado.  \\nT: Hemos hablado . To resolve it  – in order to resolve it . Now, to resolve  is resolver.  Ah? The same \\nword, resolver . So We have spoken in order to resolve it :  \\nS: Hemo s hablado para resolverlo.  \\nT: Good. Hemos hablado para resolverlo . Good. So whilst the to of to resolve , resolver , would fit \\nnicely here, I mean if we were to translate directly from English, We have spoken to resolve it , it \\ndoesn’t work in Spanish. Whene ver this to means in order to , we must put that para . Hemos \\nhablado para resolverlo . You could say We have spoken in order to try to resolve it . What was \\nto try ? Related to intention :  \\nS: Intentar .  \\nT: Good. We have spoken in order to try to resolve it :  \\nS: Hemos hablado para intentar resolvar – resolverlo.  \\nT: Good. Hemos hablado para intentar resolverlo . So only when the to implies in order to  we want \\nto put para . The “ to” form of the verb in Spanish is not enough to include that meaning. We must \\nput para . So for example, if you want to say I’m here to see you , does it mean I’m here in order \\nto see you ?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: Good. So I am here to see you  (informally):  \\nS: Estoy aquí para verte.T: Good. Estoy aquí para verte . This is also something we could learn o r interiorize through the \\nnegative language transfer that some Spanish speakers make when they speak English. For \\nexample, you might hear a Spanish speaker say I am here for see you  or for seeing you . You might \\nhear a Spanish speaker, especially with basic  English, making this mistake. Now once you’ve \\nheard that a few times, you would say, “Oh, maybe this is how you say it in Spanish.” So we don’t \\nwant to forget this opportunity, the opportunity to learn from the negative language transfer, the \\nmistakes tha t Spanish speakers make in English , which originate from Spanish. Once you hear the \\nsame mistake a few times, you can assume it probably comes from Spanish. I have called you in \\norder to speak about it : so the first bit is I have called you,  I have phoned , I have called  \\n(informally):  \\nS: He llamado . Ah, sorry. Te he llamado.  \\nT: In order to speak about it :  \\nS: Para hablarlo.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: We don’t use about .  \\nT: No. Good. Te he llamado para hablarlo . So if we take the sentence in English, I have called you  \\nto speak about it , and we translate it directly, then we will say Te he llamado hablarlo . But when \\nour to means in order to , we must put this para . Te he llamado para hablarlo . I have called you \\nin order to speak about it . Good. What was to be , for states ?  \\nS: Estar .  \\nT: Estar . And we said that we can use this to express when we are doing something right now. We \\ncan say, instead of I eat, como,  I am eating , using this structure with estar  and then the -ing form \\nof the verb. Do you remember how you would ge t the -ing form of comer , for example? Of –er or \\n–ir verbs?  \\nS: Comiendo ?  \\nT: Comiendo .  \\nS: Comiendo .T: Good. Comiendo . So we add on -iendo  for –er/-ir verbs and for –ar verbs we add on?  \\nS: -ando .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say I am eating ?  \\nS: Estoy comiendo.   \\nT: Estoy comiendo . And this means right now, no? I am speaking :  \\nS: Estoy hablando.  \\nT: Estoy hablando . I am explaining it : to explain  – we would go from explanation  but explanation  \\nis an exception. It’s not “explanación” in Spanish as we might hope, it’s explicación . And we see \\nwe even have that / k/ sound in explain, explicación , we have it in English as well in inexplicable , \\nfor example we say in English.  Inexplicable  in Spanish. So we can see where that sound’s coming \\nfrom. So how is explanati on or explication  in Spanish?  \\nS: Explicación .  \\nT: Good. And to explain :  \\nS: Explicar .  \\nT: Explicar . Good. So I’m explaining it  and you mean right now?  \\nS: Estoy explicándolo.   \\nT: Estoy explicándolo. Lo estoy explicando.  The lo can go on the end of a “to” form, but it can also \\ngo on the end of one of these -ando  or -iendo  forms as well. So you have the option. Lo estoy \\nexplicando. Estoy explicándolo . And you mean right now. Actually in explicar , we get \\nthis -plicar  from “plicare“ that we mentioned before, m eaning to fold  in Latin. So explicar , to \\nexplain , to unfold . You might want to say I’m taking a Spanish course . Even if you’re not in the \\ncourse right now in this moment, when we are taking a course, in our minds there’s a period of \\ntime in which we are  taking a course and when we say it we’re in that period of time. If I say I’m \\ntaking a Spanish course , maybe I mean for three months and I’m in that period. Do you remember \\nwhat to take  was? We used it with to take a photo . Tomar .  \\nS: Tomar .T: Tomar . So tomar  is to take . So I am taking :  \\nS: Estoy tomando.  \\nT: Good. Estoy tomando . A course : I’m going to let you guess it.  \\nS: Una corsa?  \\nT: Close. It’s not with a, it’s with o.  \\nS: Un corso.  \\nT: Un curso , with a u. Un curso . Good. Of Spanish , this is how yo u would say a Spanish course , a \\ncourse of Spanish .  \\nS: Un curso de español.  \\nT: Very good. Estoy tomando un curso de español . Good. Now, what if we put this estoy  in the \\npast tense that we learnt? The past tense that is -aba or -ía. I was taking a Spanish course :  \\nS: Estar, estaba.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Estaba tomando un curso de español.  \\nT: Good. Estaba tomando un curso de español . Which means we actually have two ways of saying \\nI was taking . We can say estaba tomando or we can just use tomar and use that line in  the past. \\nHow would that sound?  \\nS: Tomaba .  \\nT: Yes. So both tomaba  and estaba tomando mean I was taking . So you have that option. Estaba \\ntomando un curso de español or tomaba un curso de español . What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . How would you say  I was eating ?  \\nS: Comía .  \\nT: Comía . Or? How else could you say it?S: Estaba comiendo.  \\nT: So you have this option. Comía  or estaba comiendo . Most of the time they’re interchangeable, \\nsometimes one might fit slightly better than the other and it’s some thing you will pick up very \\nnaturally when you’re practicing. So if in one situation people tend to use estaba comiendo rather \\nthan comía , you will pick it up. So we have -ando  and -iendo  to form this -ing. And we saw in \\nSpanish that we don’t use it after prepositions. You don’t use this -ing either if you say something \\nlike swimming is healthy  or running is healthy . You don’t use the -ing there either. You will just \\nsay to run is healthy , to swim is healthy . If you hear people toast in Spanish you might he ar them \\nsay salud , which means health . Healthy  is saludable.  To dance is healthy :  \\nS: Bailar es saludable.  \\nT: Good. Bailar es saludable . Good. To swim  is nadar . Nadar . To swim is healthy :  \\nS: Nadar es saludable.  \\nT: Nadar es saludable . So we’re seeing tha t we don’t use the -ing in Spanish as much as we do in \\nEnglish. Sometimes in English we make an adjective with -ing. We go from to interest  to \\ninteresting . When we do this in English, this -ing that we use in English to form an adjective, in \\nSpanish it’s -ante for –ar verbs and -iente  for –er/-ir verbs. So for example, we have to interest , \\nwhat was to interest ?  \\nS: Interesar .  \\nT: Good. Interesar . So if you get rid of -ar and you put -ante, you get that -ing adjective, interesting .  \\nSo how would you say interesting ?  \\nS: Interesante .  \\nT: Interesante . Good. So when you make an adjective with -ing in English from the verb, you can \\njust replace it with -ante or -iente . How would you say to irritate  in Spanish? And you can go from \\nirritation :  \\nS: Irritación. I rritar.  \\nT: Irritar . So if you want to say irritating :S: Irritante .  \\nT: Irritante . It is irritating :  \\nS: Es irritante.  \\nT: Good. Es irritante . Good. How would you say to frustrate  in Spanish?  \\nS: Ah, frustration . Frustación . Frustar .  \\nT: Frustrar .  \\nS: Frustrar .  \\nT: Yes, because you have the two r's, no? Frustrate . Frustrate , Frustrar . Frustrating :  \\nS: Frustrante .  \\nT: Frustrante . Good. To wane , to wane , to reduce  in size, in Spanish this is menguar . Menguar .  \\nS: Menguar .  \\nT: When the moon gets smaller, it’ s waning. And the moon  is la luna .  \\nS: La luna.  \\nT: La luna . So how would you say the waning moon ?  \\nS: La luna menguante.  \\nT: Good. So there we’re making waning  like an adjective, not like the verb, not menguando . Ah? \\nMenguante, la luna menguante . Luna  is an interesting word. I don’t know if you ever noticed, \\nlike, in English Monday  is “moon day”. It’s not very obvious in English that the days of the week \\nrelate back to the planets. But in Spanish it’s very obvious. You have la luna , the moon , and then \\nyou have lunes , Monday . Tuesday  is martes . And Mars  is marte , planeta  marte . Wednesday  in \\nSpanish is miércoles . What planet does that sound like?  \\nS: Mercury .  \\nT: Yes. Jueves  in Spanish is spelt with a j:  \\nS: Jupiter .T: Jupiter . Viernes  is Friday :  \\nS: Venu s.  \\nT: Venus . So you can see much clearer there how our days of the week are named after planets. To \\nlive was vivir . V-i-v-i-r. So vivir  is to live .  \\nS: Vivir .  \\nT: Good. We have two “to be”s, we have estar  for states, and for characteristics we have?  \\nS: Ser.  \\nT: Ser. And we said that un ser , un ser , means a being , that we can use ser like a noun and we get a \\nbeing . So a human being  is?  \\nS: Un ser humano.  \\nT: Un ser humano . You could also say a living being, a living being :  \\nS: Un ser vivir.  \\nT: How do you get this –  \\nS: Vivo .  \\nT: You could say un ser vivo . Vivo  is also like an adjective, which means alive . But living  is adjective \\nthat we make with -ing. We can build it from vivir . For –ar verbs we have -ante and for –er/-ir \\nverbs we have -iente .  \\nS: Un ser viviente.  \\nT: Good. Un ser viviente . A living being . What was to go out  or to leave ?  \\nS: Voy?  \\nT: To go out  or to leave . So it’s “ to”. I don’t care if it’s wrong, but I want it to end in r.  \\nS: Ah, salir . Salir .  \\nT: Salir . Now we have in English, you mi ght have heard, salient , which means kind of protruding or \\noutstanding, or something that stands out or sticks out or protrudes. This is a Latin -English versionof this -ante/-iente  rule. So we can see it even in English. How would salient  be in Spanish? Y ou \\ncan go from salient  or you can go from salir .  \\nS: Saliente .  \\nT: Saliente . Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 53  \\nT: What was to be able , can, in the “to” form?  \\nS: Poder .  \\nT: Poder . So we have poder . If we want to make could , we have two different could 's. We have the \\ncould  that refers to the past, I couldn't do it yesterday . And we have a could  that refers to the future: \\nbut I could do it tomorrow . This future could  - we learned it already from to be able , would be \\nable: poder , “podería” and the e fell out podría . If we want  to say I could  in the past, most of the \\ntime we will probably find ourselves using this line past that we learned. The past that we make \\nwith -aba for -ar verbs and -ía for -er/-ir verbs. So how would you say I could , referring to past? \\nI could, I was abl e to:  \\nS: Podía .  \\nT: Podía . So this is I was able to, I could . The past could , podía . We could :  \\nS: Podíamos .  \\nT: Good. I couldn't do it because I didn't have the time.  For both of these we can use that line in the \\npast, that ongoing past, even though we'r e not using it in English. I couldn't do it because I didn't \\nhave the time.  So the first bit is I couldn't do it :  \\nS: No podía hacerlo .  \\nT: Good. No podía hacerlo . Because :  \\nS: Porque .  \\nT: I didn't have the time :  \\nS: No tenía el tiempo .  \\nT: Good. No podía hacerlo porque no tenía el tiempo . So we're going to contrast much more how \\nwe use this line and this dot in the past when we look at that dot. So what we're seeing for now - \\neven though we haven't looked at the dot yet - that the decisions that we need to  make in Spanish \\nabout whether we will use this line in the past, this ongoing past, or this dot, this point in the past,is a decision based on context rather than identifying which one we're using in English and then \\ntranslating it. So we can begin to lo ok at that even before we've learned the dot in the past.  \\nThe word for yesterday  was ayer . Ayer .  \\nS: Ayer .  \\nT: Good. So how would you say, I couldn't do it yesterday ?  \\nS: No podía hacerlo ayer.  \\nT: Good. No podía hacerlo ayer . And when we learn the dot form of the past, we will see that we \\ncould have used that one as well. Sometimes they're interchangeable. Sometimes this dot and this \\nline form are not interchangeable. For example, if we want to use haber  to say I had eaten  rather \\nthan I have eaten , I had gone already , rather than I have gone , then we always use the line in the \\npast. Always. So from haber , how do you say I had ?  \\nS: Había .  \\nT: Había , good. So if you want to say I had eaten , how would you say it?  \\nS: Would you say, “ había comer ”?  \\nT: You have a version of the verb that comes after haber , no matter what version of haber  we have, \\nhabía , habría, he,  it doesn't matter.  \\nS: Comido. Había comido .  \\nT: Good. Había comido . The word for already  in Spanish is ya. Y-a. Ya.  \\nS: Ya.  \\nT: And it tends to  go at the beginning. That would be the least emphatic place, the most natural place. \\nSo how would you say I had eaten already ?  \\nS: Ya había comido.  \\nT: Good. Ya había comido . So you could say, he wanted to dine with me, but  I had dined already .  \\nSo, he wanted , what is to want ?S: Querer .  \\nT: Querer . So, he wanted . Again we're using the line in the past, because even though in English \\nthere we are using the dot - we're not saying he was wanting, he used to want - with querer  we \\ncan use the line withou t any problem because most of the time, when you want something, it's not \\njust for an instant, it's kind of an ongoing feeling. The dinner was la cena . What was to dine , or to \\nhave dinner ?  \\nS: Cenar ?  \\nT: Yes. He wanted to dine with me :  \\nS: Quería cenar con mí?  \\nT: And this was a bit of an exception. You do not say “con mí”, you say:  \\nS: Ah, conmigo .  \\nT: Good. Quería cenar conmigo , but I had already had dinner. I had dined already :  \\nS: Pero ya había cenado.  \\nT: Good. But if you say, quería cenar conmigo, pero ya había cenado , I might understand he wanted \\nto dine with me , but he had dined already , no? Because we have the same verb form, so how would \\nwe make that clearer?  \\nS: Just saying yo at some point.  \\nT: Exactly. But where? So give it to me again, and w e can say the word for he as well, especially \\nwhen we are contrasting between two people, we will have the habit of putting who. So, he wanted \\nto dine with me, but I had dined already :  \\nS: Él quería cenar conmigo pero yo ya había ... so dined , cenaría , no.  \\nT: No.  \\nS: Cenía .  \\nT: What you want to translate is not dined . You want to find the version after haber . This is going to \\nsave you a lot of pain.S: Cenado .  \\nT: Good. He wanted to have dinner with me but I had already had dinner . Él quería cenar conmigo \\npero yo ya había cenado . Now we don't need to look at or discuss when we use had as opposed \\nto when we use have , when we use I had lost it as opposed to I have lost it , because it's exactly the \\nsame in Spanish as it is in English. So you will just translat e the thought, let's say. For example, \\nyou might want to say, he was looking for it because I had lost it . He was looking for it because I \\nhad lost it . To look for is buscar , buscar , to look for .  \\nS: Buscar .  \\nT: Good. Buscar , to look for . So, he was lookin g for it, he was searching for it :  \\nS: Buscía .  \\nT: Check the ending first.  \\nS: Buscaba .  \\nT: Good. He was looking for it :  \\nS: Lo buscaba.  \\nT: To lose  was?  \\nS: Perder .  \\nT: Because I had lost it :  \\nS: Porque yo lo había perdido.  \\nT: Good. Lo buscaba , or él lo buscaba, porque yo lo había perdido . Good. How would you say, I \\nwould have lost it - so not I had lost it, I would have lost it ?  \\nS: Lo habería perdido.  \\nT: Good. I would have lost it . Lo habría perdido . Now I'm not sure if you said habría  or “habería” \\nbecause this irregularity that we have which is habría  happens so naturally because that e kind of \\nfalls out  so naturally. I think you said “habería”, but you kind of didn't pronounce the e well. Is \\nthat right?S: I meant to say “ habería ”.  \\nT: Yes. S o you see that naturally it's happening, that e of haber  is falling away, and that has been \\nformalised in Spanish. You write it like this, h-a-b-r-i-a. Habría . Only with a few verbs, this \\ncontraction is occurring. Habría . Lo habría perdido . I would have lo st it. How would you say, I \\nwould have got lost , or I would have lost myself ?  \\nS: Me habría perdido.  \\nT: Good. Me habría perdido . Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 54  \\nT: Now, these versions of the verb  that we get after haber , and we said that it’s any version of haber , \\nwhether it’s he, whether it’s había , whether it’s habría , we could even say I will have. I will have \\nlost it – lo habré perdido . Any version of haber  - we will have the -ado, -ido version after it, even \\nif it’s in the “to” form – we could say something like I would like to have gone. I would like to \\nhave gone . I would like, it would please me :  \\nS: Me gustaría .    \\nT: To have gone.   \\nS: Haber ido .  \\nT: Me gustaría haber ido , it would please me to have gone, I would like to have gone , me gustaría \\nhaber ido . So, even after the “to” form we’re having just one version of the verb that can come \\nafter haber . Now, this version of the verb that can come after haber  is very useful, because, if it \\nmakes sense, we can use it as an adjective, just as we can in English. For example , in English we \\nsay: I have sold . And sold we can use like an adjective, we can say it is sold . We say I have lost . \\nAnd we can use it like an adjective – I am lost . And you can do the same in Spanish, which gives \\nyou hundreds and hundreds of words  now that you can access as adjectives. So, for example, to \\nclose is cerrar . Cerrar .  \\nS: Cerrar .  \\nT: How would you say: I have closed it ? I have closed it :  \\nS: Lo he cerrado.   \\nT: Good. Lo he cerrado . You might be referring to the door , which is la puerta . So, if you were \\nreferring to the door , how would you say that? I have closed it :  \\nS: La he cerrado .  \\nT: Good. La he cerrado . Good. So cerrado  – we can take that and we can use it as an adjective. \\nNow, it doesn’t change ever after haber  – it’s always cerrado: lo he cerrado, la he cerrado, lohemos cerrado . But, when it’s an adjective, when it’s behaving like an adjective, then of course, \\nit can change. So, if you say it is closed and you mean the door , how would you say it?  \\nS: Cerrada .  \\nT: Good, so how wo uld you say that, it is closed ?  \\nS: Es cerrada .  \\nT: You think to be closed  is a state or a characteristic?  \\nS: Está cerrada.   \\nT: Está cerrada . In fact, the great majority, with just a couple of exceptions, of these adjectives that \\nwe get from -ado, -ido, that we get from the version that comes after haber , go with estar . With \\nthis particular type of adjective we don’t need to really think about whether it’s a state or a \\ncharacteristic, they are just gonna go with estar , with a couple of exceptions. To los e was:  \\nS: Perder .  \\nT: What is the version that comes after haber , after any form of haber ? Perder  becomes:  \\nS: Perdido .  \\nT: Perdido . So, how would you say: I am lost ?  \\nS: Estoy perdido , or female, perdida .  \\nT: Good. Estoy perdido , or for feminine, perdi da. Good. What was to finish or to terminate ?    \\nS: Terminar .  \\nT: Terminar . How would you say: I have finished ?  \\nS: He terminado .  \\nT: Good. He terminado . So now you can also say it is finished,  and use it like an adjective.  \\nS: Está terminado.  \\nT: Good. Está terminado . What if you were referring to the movie , which is la película :  \\nS: Está terminada .T: Good. Está terminada . Good. So, this gives us a lot of adjectives we can access. Let’s have a look \\nat some of them. To sell was vender , and then sold would be:  \\nS: Vendido .  \\nT: Good. They are sold :  \\nS: Están vendidos.  \\nT: Están vendidos . And if we mean las casas , how will it sound?  \\nS: Están vendidas.   \\nT: Good. Están vendidas . Good. Some of the adjectives that we already met are actually adjectives \\nthat we re formed in this way. How was the word for tired ?  \\nS: Cansado .  \\nT: Cansado . And this comes from the verb cansar , to tire . So cansar  is to tire , and then cansado  is \\nthe version that you get after haber , and it’s the adjective, cansado , tired. So, if you wa nt to say I \\nget tired, I tire myself , so now it’s present:  \\nS: Me canso.  \\nT: Me canso . That means I get tired or even I get fed up . How would you say I have tired myself ? \\nAnd like I said, it doesn’t literally mean that you are responsible for tiring yourself, it just means \\nthat you’ve got tired or you can use it like “I’ve had enough”. So, I have tired myself :  \\nS: He- Me he cansado.  \\nT: Good. Me he cansado . I’ve gotten tired, I’ve gotten fed up . Good. And then cansado  - which is \\nthe version of cansar  after haber  - is also, of course, the adjective tired . I am tired :  \\nS: Estoy cansada.  \\nT: Good. So, to close is cerrar , and we said that closed  is cerrado.  And we said that these –ado, -ido \\nadjectives, with a couple of exceptions, go with estar . So, how  would you say it is closed ?  \\nS: Está cerrado.T: Good. How would you say he is closed to the idea - idea is the same word in Spanish. He is closed \\nto the idea :  \\nS: Está cerrado a el idea?  \\nT: What gender does it look like: idea?  \\nS: La idea.  \\nT: Está c errado a la idea . He is closed to the idea . But if you want to say he is a closed person , you \\nmean as a person he is closed , how do you think you would say it?  \\nS: Es un person cerrado?  \\nT: Almost. This is exactly the structure that we want, well done. But , the word for person  is feminine, \\nit doesn’t refer to anybody specifically, just the word itself is feminine.  \\nS: Es una persona cerrado - cerrada.  \\nT: Good. Cerrada  refers to person . Very good. Es una persona cerrada . So that’s how we can get \\naround that,  if we want to say he is closed and we mean he is a closed person . If we just say es \\ncerrado  it sounds like a mistake. But es una persona cerrada is fine, because es is going with \\npersona , what you are saying essentially is he is a person that is closed . Es una persona cerrada .  \\nHow would you say she is lost ?  \\nS: Está perdida.  \\nT: Good. Está perdida , she is lost.  But if you want to say She is lost , you know, as a person, she’s \\nlost her way :  \\nS: Es una persona perdida . Well, actually, why not está here?  \\nT: In this structure you are saying she is a person , you are not looking at lost person , you are looking \\nat person . The adjective is totally secondary. So when you say this is a chair you are going to use \\nser. If you are going to say it’s a wet chair , even thought that is a state, you are still going to use \\nser. Because what you are saying is it’s a chair , the adjective is secondary. But, if you say it is \\nwet, then you use estar.  So, chair  or seat is silla. Silla .  \\nS: Silla.T: Good. Mojar , mojar  means to wet . Mojar . Now, how do you think you say wet as an adjective?  \\nS: Mojada .  \\nT: Good. For silla, mojada . Feminine. Good. So, how would you say the chair,  la silla , the chair is \\nwet?  \\nS: La silla está mojada.  \\nT: Good. La silla está mojada . But, if you say it is a wet chair , you are just saying it is a chair , and \\nthen an adjective is secondary, and the fact that it is a chair is about as characteristic as it gets.  \\nSo, you are saying it is a chair :  \\nS: Es una silla.   \\nT: Wet:  \\nS: Mojada.   \\nT: Es una silla mojada . So, when we say something is a noun, when we give it its name, there’s \\nnothing more characteristic. Es una persona , it is a person ; it is a happy person , es una persona \\nfeliz. It’s a chair , es una silla ; it’s a wet chair , es una silla mojada . The structure there is it is a \\nchair , the adjective is secondary. But, when we say the chair is wet , then we are talking about a \\nstate of the chair with is: la silla está mojada . Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 55  \\nT: What was the to have , that we use to go in the past?  \\nS: Haber .  \\nT: Haber . Good. How would you say I have cancel led? I have cancel led:  \\nS: He cancelado.  \\nT: Good. He cancelado . And we said that the version of the verb that you get after haber  – you can \\nuse it like an adjective as well in Spanish, just as we d o in English. For example in English we \\ncould say it’s cance lled. We use the same version, cance lled, that comes after haber . So we can \\ndo the same in Spanish. So, how would you say it is cance lled, and I remind you that the adjectives \\nthat we form in this  way tend to go with estar , only with a few exceptions that are more flexible. \\nSo it is cancel led:  \\nS: Está cancelado.  \\nT: Está cancelado . What if we meant la fiesta , the party ?  \\nS: Está cancelada.  \\nT: Good. Está cancelada . Fiesta , by the way is actually  related to festival , festivity , we can see the e \\nsplitting between festival  and fiesta . To complicate  in Spanish, what’s complication ?  \\nS: Complicación , complicar .  \\nT: Complicar , “with folding”, complicar . Good. If you want to say it has got complicated , it has got \\ncomplicated , how do you think you will say it?  \\nS: Se ha complicado.  \\nT: Good. Se ha complicado . It has got complicated . It has complicated itself , we would say. Very \\ngood. So, the adjective complicated  is:  \\nS: Complicado .  \\nT: Complicado . Good. So, you can say: It is complicated :S: Es complicado.  \\nT: Es complicado . Or?  \\nS: Está complicado.  \\nT: Está complicado . Actually, with this one you can use either; there tends to be a tendency to go \\nwith estar  with these types of adjectives, but wit h complicado  you could say either. Es \\ncomplicado , está complicado , depending on what you were talking about, you might feel more \\ndrawn to one or to the other, but most of the time they are going to be interchangeable here. We \\ncan also make structures like should have , could have  with this haber . Let’s start with should have . \\nNow should , we take it from the verb to owe , which also we use like must , and it’s related to \\nEnglish debt.  \\nS: Deber .  \\nT: Deber . Deber . Good. So, deber  is to owe  or must. And if you sa y would owe  you get should . So, \\nhow would you say I should ?  \\nS: Debería .  \\nT: Good. So now we can say I should have canceled , and this have  is to have . I should to have \\ncanceled :  \\nS: Debería haber cancelado.  \\nT: Very good. I should have canceled.  Debería haber cancelado . I should have canceled it :  \\nS: Lo debería haber cancelado.  \\nT: Very good. Lo debería haber cancelado . Where else could that lo go there?  \\nS: It’s after the unchanged verb, so debería haberlo cancelado .  \\nT: Yeah, debería haberlo cancelado . Very good. What was could ? So, we take to be able  and we \\nsay would be able  to get this could,  this could  that refers to future. So, what is to be able , related \\nto power ?  \\nS: Poder .T: Poder . Good. So how would you say I would be able  or I could ?  \\nS: Podería .  \\nT: Okay,  \\nS: Podría .  \\nT: Podría . So, you could say something like I could have gone . I could have gone . What was to go ?  \\nS: Ir.  \\nT: Ir. And what was gone , the version of to go  after haber ?  \\nS: Ido.  \\nT: I could have gone :  \\nS: Podría hab er ido.  \\nT: Podría haber ido . We could have gone . We could have gone :  \\nS: Podríamos haber ido.  \\nT: Good. Podríamos haber ido . Good. So, after haber , any version of haber , whether it’s the “to” \\nform, haber , whether it’s habría , any version of haber , it’s going to have –ado or –ido with the \\nfollowing verb. But some verbs are irregular and they don’t form their version after haber  in this \\nway. So, to break , related to rupture  in English, was romper . Now, this after haber  is not \\n“rompido”, “rompido” doesn’ t exist, it’s irregular, after haber  it’s roto: r-o-t-o, roto. So, how \\nwould you say I have broken it ?  \\nS: Lo he roto.  \\nT: Good. Lo he roto . I have broken them :  \\nS: Los he roto.  \\nT: Good. Los he roto . What if you want to say it has broken ? It has br oken :  \\nS: Se ha roto.T: Se ha roto . It has broken itself . It has broken . Very good. If you had just said ha roto  I would \\nunderstand he, she, it or you (formal) has or have broken , and I would be waiting to hear what was \\nbroken. So, we have roto instead of “rompido”, let’s say . Roto  is the version of romper  after \\nhaber , which means it will also count for the adjective. So, if you want to say it is broken , how \\nwould you say it?  \\nS: Está roto.  \\nT: Está roto . And if it was a feminine thin g?  \\nS: Está rota.  \\nT: Está rota . To die is morir , morir .  \\nS: Morir .  \\nT: And the version after haber is not “morido”, it’s muerto , muerto . How would you say he has \\ndied?  \\nS: Ha muerto.  \\nT: Ha muerto . And with morir  you can hear it with se or without se, there is not really a lot of \\ndifference, sometimes the se doesn’t actually make a lot of difference - ha muerto, se ha muerto  \\n- you hear both. Now, if you want to say he is dead , how do you think you would say it?  \\nS: You mean as if it’s estar  or ser?  \\nT: W e know that this type of adjective tends to go with:  \\nS: Well, estar , but I could see why this specific one could also go with ser under certain \\ncircumstances.  \\nT: Yes, but it doesn’t, it never goes with ser. So, some of these adjectives we form in this wa y can go \\nwith ser, but this one can’t. So, firstly, how would that be, he is dead ?  \\nS: Está muerto.  \\nT: Está muerto . So, complicated , for example, could go with ser and estar , but muerto  can’t. Maybe \\nit’s not just because they are this type of adje ctive, that dead  will go with estar , maybe it is about \\nthe way Spanish perceives the world . To be dead is a state, that the soul goes through, let’s say,you don’t know what is the perception behind that, or, if it’s just going with estar  because it’s  one \\nof these adjectives. So, the y are interesting points to think about, and thinking about those points \\nhelps your memory, even if you are just looking out of interest and not coming to any conclusions. \\nHow would you say I’m dead  (and you can use thi s to mean tired) ? This is quite common in \\nSpanish, if you are really tired, you can say oh, I’m dead.   \\nS: Estoy muerta.  \\nT: Yes, feminine. Estoy muerta . Good. You can say also I die myself  here, like morirse , in all \\ndifferent kinds of circumstances, when s omething’s really funny, when you can’t believe \\nsomething, in many different circumstances you could use that, you will hear it around, but let’s \\nbuild it, let’s see how it would sound. So, to die , morir , I die myself , making this reflexive \\nstructure, how would it sound?  \\nS: It’s irregular so the “mue” is going to come in. Muero , maybe? Muero ?  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: Me muero.  \\nT: Me muero . Good. Me muero . So, you will hear this all the time actually in Spanish, ay, me \\nmuero , maybe from embarrassment, maybe from laugh ter, maybe from disbelief, it’s a common \\nthing – me muero . To open in Spanish is abrir , abrir .  \\nS: Abrir .  \\nT: Abrir . And if you want to say I have opened it,  you say lo he abierto . So we don’t have “abrido” \\nafter haber , we have abierto . Another irregular o ne. Lo he abierto .  \\nS: Is it with an h?  \\nT: No, good question though, good that you are thinking about that. Abrir  is a-b-r-i-r. Abrir  becomes \\nabierto . So, how would you say it is open ?  \\nS: Está abierto.  \\nT: Good. Está abierto . How would you say they are open ?  \\nS: Están abierto.T: Están ,  \\nS: Están abiertos.  \\nT: Good. Están abiertos . Decir  and hacer , to say or to tell , decir , and to make or to do,  hacer , also \\nare irregular after haber . These two verbs are quite irregular in most places, we will pay them a \\nlittle more attention later. So decir , to say or to tell , and hacer , to do and to make , are irregular \\nafter haber . Decir  becomes dicho , dicho , and hacer  becomes hecho ; which is why they are nice \\nto see together, because they both have this / ch/ soun d. Decir  becomes dicho , and hacer  becomes \\nhecho . So, how would you say I have said it ? I have said it :  \\nS: Lo he dicho.  \\nT: Good. Lo he dicho . And what if you wanted to say I have told him ?  \\nS: Lo he dicho .  \\nT: But what we want here is not him; what want here is to him . I have told to him :  \\nS: Le he dicho.  \\nT: Good. Le he dicho . Good. We have told him :  \\nS: Le hemos dicho.  \\nT: Good. Le hemos dicho . Good. Interestingly, dicho  is also a noun. We said that some version of \\nthe verb can form the noun; som etimes it’s the “to” form, sometimes it’s the “I” form, sometimes \\nit’s the “he, she, it” form. Here it’s this form. Un dicho  is a saying, a saying . Hacer  after haber  \\nbecomes hecho . So, how would you say I have done it  or I have made it ?  \\nS: Lo he hecho.  \\nT: Good. Lo he hecho . I should have done it . I should have done it . I should :  \\nS: Debería .  \\nT: I should have done it :  \\nS: Debería haberlo hecho?T: Yes! Debería haberlo hecho . Of course we can put the lo there because we have haber  in the “to” \\nform. Debería  haberlo  hecho  or lo debería haber hecho . Very good. You should have done it  \\n(informally):  \\nS: Deberías haberlo hecho.  \\nT: Good. Deberías haberlo hecho . How would you say it is done ? It is done :  \\nS: Está hecho.  \\nT: Good. Está hecho . You might  also see this used like hecho en China , made in China , or hecho \\nen España , made in Spain , you will see this on products, should be a nice reminder. So, hecho  as \\nan adjective, made  or done , está hecho , it is done , it is made ; but, it can also be a noun: un hecho , \\nun hecho  is a fact , and it’s actually connected to the word fact, even though they look so different. \\nThere is in Spanish and English what we can call a kind of grey area between h’s and f’s, because \\nin a phonetic change that occurred in Spanish ma ny f’s became silent h’s, just as hecho  is from \\nhacer , fact is from to do , so “faire”, like in French, if you know some French, is to do , and fact is \\nrelated to “faire”, just as hecho  is related to hacer . And we can find some other connections \\nbetween this  f and this silent h, between English and Spanish . For example in English we have \\nfable , a fable is a story, and a story is spoken, and from there we see the relation with hablar . \\nFable , hablar . We have fugitive , which is the same root as huir, h-u-i-r, huir, which means to \\nescape  or to run away  in Spanish. We have hermano  or hermana  in Spanish, brother or sister , \\nspelled h-e-r-m-a-n-o, or with an a on the end for hermana , and there we see the connection with \\nfraternal.  Hembra , which means female , h-e-m-b-r-a. Even within Spanish you can see this \\nphenomenon of the h’s and the f’s. For example you have iron which is hierro , h-i-e-r-r-o, hierro , \\niron, and then you get ferrocarril , which means railways , so they look totally unrelated, but if you \\nknow that the f became the silent h and that the e split into ie you can see the connection between \\nhierro  and ferrocarril . You have profundo , profundo , profound,  in Spanish, as you do in \\nEnglish, and then you have hondo , which means deep , so hondo  is the “fundo” bit of profundo , \\nbut with some changes, hondo , h-o-n-d-o to mean deep . Fumar  means to smoke . And then humo , \\nh-u-m-o, is smoke , like a noun, el humo , the smoke . So there are some interesting things we can \\nfind between English and Spanish and within Spanish itself with these f’s and h’s. Also you can \\nlook out for some connections with other letters, you will find other pairs of letters like this, forexample w’s and g’s – you get war in English and guerra  in Spanish, William  in English and \\nGuillermo  in Spanish . So this is an interesting thing to keep an eye out for to make connections \\nbetween vocabulary and, of course, in this way aid your memory.',\n",
       " 'Track 56  \\nT: We’ve seen quite a few prepositions up until now, these words that refer to movement or position \\nor direction. For example, we had two words for for, what were they?  \\nS: Para  and por.  \\nT: Good. Para  and por. And how did we say from  or of?  \\nS: De.  \\nT: De. With :  \\nS: Con.  \\nT: Con. In or on:  \\nS: En.  \\nT: En. Good, so we’ve seen quite a few of those. Now, prepositions in Spanish won’t come at the end \\nof the sentence, as they can in English. We’ve seen this already as well. Do you remember how to \\nsay Where are you from? You are  (speaking informally) from ser is eres. Eres . So, how would \\nyou say Where are you from? :  \\nS: ¿De dónde eres ?  \\nT: ¿De dónde eres ? So, in English Where are you from?  We’re putting the preposition at the end of \\nthe sentence, and that’s fine in English, but it’s incorrect Spanish. So, you don’t say Where are \\nyou from? You say From where are you?  ¿De dónde eres?  If we want to say Where are you \\ngoing? in Spanish , we say To where are you going?  What was You are going  (speaking \\ninformally )?  \\nS: Vas.  \\nT: Vas. Good, so, to where are you going? :  \\nS: ¿A dónde vas?T: ¿A dó nde vas ? Good. We are going to the United States . The United States is Estados Unidos , \\nUnited States,  Estados Unidos , and I should mention, you don’t translate the word for the, you \\njust say we are going to United States .  \\nS: Vamos a Estados Unidos .  \\nT: Vamos a Estados Unidos . We discussed the concept before about working backwards. So, instead \\nof building up to say what we want to say, finding bits of language and working backwards to find \\nthe “to” form of the verb . So, for example, imagine we looked u p somewhere United States , or we \\nasked somebody how to say United States , and we came across Estados Unidos . We can use \\nUnidos  to work backwards to work out what is the verb to unite . How do you think that is?  \\nS: Unidar ?  \\nT: Not guessing, but really worki ng backwards, which, instead of building up, building down; instead \\nof adding bits on to the verb, seeing what has been added and consciously taking it off.  \\nS: So, -ido has been added, when you add –ido you take off the ending of the “to” form.  \\nT: And wh at is the ending with –ido?  \\nS: -ir.  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: -er.  \\nT: You should experiment and see which one feels more natural to you. Now, the one that you may \\nhave heard before is probably going to feel more natural even if you didn’t register it, so if you \\nheard before the correct version, it’s going to feel more natural, and also, the more words you learn \\nin Spanish the greater intuition you get about the phonetics of Spanish, what sounds more Spanish. \\nSo, that should direct you when you say “Uner , Unir, Uner , Unir”, to understand which one is to \\nunite . Which one do you think it is?  \\nS: Somehow I think that it’s unir.  \\nT: Unir . But, at this stage there is no reason for you to know what sounds more Spanish; this intuition \\nis something that occurs with practice and exposure and listening. But working backwards is auseful skill that we want to employ in our language -learning journey. So, we said that prepositions \\nwon’t come at the end, so if we say, for example, the girl I work with , in Spanish we will say the \\ngirl with which, with that, with who, I work . We have the option. So what was to work , do you \\nremember?  \\nS: Trabajo .  \\nT: To-  \\nS: Trabajar .  \\nT: Trabajar , to work . Good. The girl  is la chica , la chica , it’s kind of informal, but very common.  \\nLa chica .  How do  you think the guy would be if the girl is la chica ?  \\nS: El chico ?  \\nT: El chico . So, we can begin with the one that we know already, which is with that , con que . The \\ngirl with that I work :  \\nS: La chica con que yo trabajo .  \\nT: La chica con que trabajo , you don’t need the yo unless you are emphasizing, la chica con que \\nyo trabajo . We could also say with which , la chica con cual trabajo , we could say with who , la \\nchica con quien trabajo . We could even put la que or la cual , which means which  or that, but \\nwe ar e showing that it’s a feminine which  or a feminine that, la chica con la cual trabajo , la chica \\ncon la que trabajo . You have all of those options in Spanish, but don’t worry about them, you \\ncan just use que. So, whilst you have all of those options and you  will hear them, and when you \\nget comfortable with hearing them and understanding them you will start using the different ones \\nwithout really thinking about it very much; you don’t want to worry about it now, que you can use \\nfor everything, for all of that . La chica con que trabajo .  \\nS: So, it’s correct?  \\nT: Yeah, it’s correct Spanish. But you have all of those options: la chica con cual trabajo; la chica \\ncon la cual trabajo, la chica con la que trabajo, la chica con quien trabajo . The girl that I was \\nworki ng with . So, how would you say it is the girl I was working with ? Let’s go for it slowly.It is the girl :  \\nS: Es la chica.  \\nT: With who :  \\nS: Con que.  \\nT: Con que . I was working, I used to work :  \\nS: So, it’s trabajar , and that becomes –aba, trabaja ba.  \\nT: Good, all together, it’s the girl I was working with :  \\nS: Es la chica con que trabajaba.  \\nT: Es la chica con que trabajaba . How would you say the girl with whom, the girl that I was going \\nto the party with. The girl with whom, or with that, with wh ich, all of those are okay in Spanish.  \\nS: La chica con que -  \\nT: La chica con que , I was going to the party . So, I was going is the line version of ir, which is \\nirregular, but we can remember that it takes a little bit from the two options that we have to make \\nthe line version. We have –aba for –ar verbs and –ía for –er/-ir verbs; and the verb ir kind of \\nblended together –aba and –ía and came up with:  \\nS: Iba.  \\nT: So, you can think of it that way: you can think of it like –aba and –ía kind of blending toget her, to \\nhave iba, or you can think of it like the present va, but with an i before. In the past it’s spelled with \\na b: i-b-a, iba, where in the present it’s spelled with a v, v-a, but as we know they are very similar \\nsounding, so it’s like the present with  an i before. So, in the present you have he is goin g, él va , or \\nél /ba/, and then in the past,  él iba . So I was going, he was going, she was going , it was going, you \\n(formal ) were going is:  \\nS: Iba.  \\nT: Iba. So, the girl with which I was going to the pa rty:  \\nS: La chica con que iba a la fiesta.T: Good. La chica con que iba a la fiesta . So, you can say la chica con la cual , la chica con quien , \\nla chica con la que – you have all of these options. Let’s use cual in a sentence, which is the word \\nfor which , and it’s not just a which  like this to connect the girl with which , you can also use it like \\na question: which one do you want?  You probably can guess, we don’t need the word for one.  \\nS: ¿Cuál quieres ?  \\nT: Good. Which one do you want ? ¿Cuál quieres ? Good . So cuál, cuál, c-u-a-l, means which . I know , \\nfrom saber , to know , was sé; we said it’s very irregular, just s-e, I know .  \\nS: Sé.  \\nT: Good. How would you say I don’t know which one he wants ?  \\nS: No sé cual quiere.  \\nT: Good. No sé cual quiere . How would you say I don’t know which one he wants to see ?  \\nS: No sé cual quiere ver.  \\nT: No sé cual quiere ver . Good. Now, what if you wanted to say I don’t know with which one he \\nwants to do it, I don’t know which one he wants to do it with :  \\nS: No sé con cual qu iere hacer - it with ?  \\nT: Well, you said the with already.  \\nS: Lo!  \\nT: Yeah.  \\nS: So, it’s just lo at the end?  \\nT: Yeah, and you might feel this temptation often to repeat the preposition again at the end, even if \\nyou put it before , because that English is p ushing through with the negative language transfer. No \\nsé con cual quiere hacerlo , I don’t know with which one he wants to do it , I don’t know which \\none he wants to do it with . So, we don’t put the preposition at the end of the sentence in Spanish, \\nwe will  rearrange the sentence and whilst this sounds more formal in English, of course it doesn’t \\nsound more formal in Spanish, it’s just the only correct option. The word for who, we’ve mentioned \\nvery briefly is quién , quién .S: Quién .  \\nT: Good. If you want to  say who is going?, what verb version will who go with? Who is who? Is it \\nyou, is it them , is it he/she/it ? Who is who?  \\nS: He/she/it.  \\nT: Good. So, how would you say who is going? :  \\nS: ¿Quién va?  \\nT: ¿Quién va ? Good. And in Spanish you have the plural of who, if you are expecting more than one \\nperson, if you know that your who refers to more than one person, you can put quien  into plural, \\nso, how do you think that would sound?  \\nS: Quienes ?  \\nT: Yeah. Quienes . So if you want to say who is going?  And you know  it’s more than one person?  \\nS: ¿Quiénes van ?  \\nT: Good, and you changed the verb as well to match. ¿ Quiénes van ? Good. How would you say:  \\nWho is here? :  \\nS: ¿Quién es aquí ?  \\nT: You know -  \\nS: Está !  \\nT: Yes, it’s your location.  \\nS: ¿Quién está aquí ?  \\nT: Good . ¿Quién está aquí ? And if you knew you were talking about here, you could just leave that \\nout as we have the sense of location with estar , we don’t really need to say the here, if we know \\nthat we are talking about here. Like we said before, if you knock o n someone’s door you just say \\n¿Estás?  Because we are using estar , and we are talking about states, that’s enough context for us \\nif we just leave it by itself to understand that we are speaking about location. So, you could just \\nsay who is?S: ¿Quién está?   \\nT: ¿Quién está ? I don’t know with who I have to do it. I don’t know who I have to do it with.  How is \\nI have to , what have do we use to get the meaning of have to ?  \\nS: Tengo - tener .  \\nT: Tener . Tener , to have . I have :  \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Good, and to get the meaning of I have to :  \\nS: Tengo que.  \\nT: Tengo que . So, I don’t know who I have to do it with, I don’t know with who I have to do it :  \\nS: No sé con quien tengo que hacerlo.  \\nT: Good. No sé con quien tengo que hacerlo . Or if you knew we meant more than one person, no sé \\ncon quienes tengo que hacerlo . Good. How would you say I don’t know who I have to do it for, \\nI don’t know for who I have to do it :  \\nS: No sé para quien tengo que hacerlo.   \\nT: Good. No sé para quien lo tengo que hacer  or no sé para quién tengo  que hacerlo . Good. What \\nif you wanted to say I don’t know who I have to do it because of , I don’t know who I have to do it \\nbecause of , so how would that sound?  \\nS: No sé por quien tengo que hacerlo.  \\nT: No sé por quien lo tengo que hacer, no sé por quien tengo que hacerlo.',\n",
       " \"Track 57  \\nT: What is to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar . -ar verb, and to eat :  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . -er verb, and to live :  \\nS: Vivir .  \\nT: Vivir . -ir verb. Good, so there we have an –ar, -er and –ir verb, and we saw –ar verbs form one \\ngroup, and –er/-ir verbs form another group. But, we have one time in the entire Spanish language, \\nwhere there is a difference between –er and –ir verbs, otherwise they are always forming one \\ngroup. But just one occasion in the whole Spanish language, where t here is a difference between \\nthem. How do you say we speak or we are speaking ?  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . How would you say we eat or we are eating ?  \\nS: Comemos .  \\nT: Comemos . Good, and how is we live ?  \\nS: Vivimos .  \\nT: Vivimos . Good. So, for -er verbs we u se -emos  for we in the present, and for -ir verbs we use -imos  \\nfor we in the present. But of course for the other versions they are using the same endings, for \\nexample, he eats  is:  \\nS: Come .  \\nT: Come . We use / e/. He lives:  \\nS: Vive .  \\nT: Vive . Again we are using an e. They eat , or you guys eat :S: Comen .  \\nT: Good. They live or you guys live :  \\nS: Viven .  \\nT: Viven . Where do you guys live? :  \\nS: ¿Dónde viven?  \\nT: ¿Dónde viven ? Very good. What was the word for it? Not eat, but it, i-t:  \\nS: Lo.  \\nT: Lo. Good. Ther e’s a couple of interesting and useful things we can do with lo, it, in Spanish, which \\nwe can’t do in English. For example, when you want to say the interesting thing, the complicated \\nthing is , the interesting thing is , the difficult thing about that is , instead of saying the word for \\nthing , in Spanish you can just say, for example, lo interesante . Lo interesante means the \\ninteresting thing . So, you get the structure the interesting thing with lo interesante . So, how would \\nyou say, for example, the int eresting thing is that they live here ? The interesting thing is that they \\nlive here :  \\nS: Lo interesante es que viven aquí.  \\nT: Very good. Lo interesante es que viven aquí . Very good. How would you say the interesting \\nthing is that they live together ? Now, the word for together  in Spanish is junto , junto .  \\nS: Junto .  \\nT: This is the singular masculine version. J-u-n-t-o. Now, it’s related to junction , it doesn’t sound like \\nit, but when you realize that junto  is with j, then you can see how it’s related to junction  in English \\nand join. The interesting thing is that they live together :  \\nS: Lo interesante es que viven junto?  \\nT: Good, but it’s them, no? They , viven :  \\nS: Juntos .  \\nT: Good. Lo interesante es que viven juntos . Or, if they were two females, you would  say:S: Juntas .  \\nT: Good. Lo interesante es que viven juntas . The interesting thing is that they live together.  What \\ndo you think fácil means? Fácil :  \\nS: Easy .  \\nT: Easy . Why?  \\nS: Facilitate .  \\nT: Facilitate . Good. To facilitate  is to make easy , so, we h ave fácil, easy. So, if you wanted to say the \\neasy thing , how would you say that?  \\nS: Lo fácil.  \\nT: Lo fácil , and then you will carry on, so we can say the easy thing is that they come together . The \\neasy thing is that they come together :  \\nS: Lo fácil  es que , venir  is irregular, right?  \\nT: Try and build it, see what happens, go there first and then see.  \\nS: It’s not “vieno”, no it’s vengo .  \\nT: But you are going for the “they” version, so don’t go from venir  to “I” version to “they” version . \\nS: But I might as well remember it.  \\nT: Why? That’s how you get lost, right? What you want to do is focus your thoughts on just what you \\nhave in front of you, which is going from venir  to the “they” form, and try to build it as it should \\nbe, and then when you get that result, then have a look at maybe if it’s irregular, if it doesn’t feel \\nright  -  \\nS: So, is it vienen ?  \\nT: Of course! You see?  \\nS: Yeah. The “I” one though! My mind is trying to remember.T: Vengo . But it’s not important, if you don’t need it now it shouldn’t be important for you, because \\nwith everything you will remember, you will remember something similar that you don’t \\nremember . If you let that occupy your thoughts then you are gonna block. You need to be \\ncomfortable with a level of unce rtainty to learn a language. If you want to have the whole panorama \\nof the whole language before you start speaking, you will never start speaking. And sooner or later \\nwe are gonna come across again that thought that distracted us cause we are gonna want t o say it, \\nand in that moment we will sort it out. So, the more we do that, the more you are gonna control \\nthis panorama of Spanish, that makes you a little bit insecure right now, because you know so \\nmuch and you feel like it’s all floating around.  The easy thing is that they come together :  \\nS: Lo fácil es que vienen juntos.  \\nT: Good. Lo fácil es que vienen juntos . Very good. How would you say the complicated thing is \\nthat they come together :  \\nS: Complicación  – complicar  – complicado ?  \\nT: Yeah.  \\nS: So, lo complicado es que vienen juntos .  \\nT: Lo complicado es que vienen juntos . Good. So we can say lo bueno , the good thing ; lo malo , \\nthe bad thing . Malo is bad, like in malnutritioned , that means badly  nutritioned , so that’s a useful \\nstructure. Before we  said de esta forma , in this way , de esta forma . We could also say de esta \\nmanera , in this manner , but very very common in Spanish when we want to say like this , like that , \\nis the word así, a-s-i, así.  \\nS: Así.  \\nT:  Así means like this or like that . So, if you want to say something like we don’t speak like this, we \\ndon’t speak in that way , you don’t really need to say de esa manera or de esa forma , you can just \\ntake this wonderful shortcut for  like this or like that , which is así. So, like this , like th at, así.  \\nSo, we don’t speak like that , we don’t speak in that way :  \\nS: No hablamos así.  \\nT: No hablamos así . We don’t eat like that :S: No comemos así.  \\nT: No comemos así . We don’t live like that :  \\nS: No vivimos así.  \\nT: No vivimos así . Good. Another int eresting thing that we can do with lo, a useful structure we can \\nmake with lo, is lo de . The combination of lo and de means like the thing about . So we see how \\nlo can sometimes replace  thing , lo interesante , the interesting thing , and lo de is like the thi ng \\nabout . So, for example, if you wanted to say the thing about the party , you just say lo de la fiesta . \\nSo if you want to say we are speaking about the thing about the party - not we are speaking about \\nthe party , but we are speaking about that issue of th e party, that thing we know what we are \\nreferring to , we are speaking about that business about the party,  hablamos lo de la fiesta . Or \\nhablamos sobre , about , you could say that as well, hablamos sobre lo de la fiesta . You can even \\nsay de, we speak of , hab lamos de lo de la fiesta . You can say that business about Juan, that thing \\nabout Juan , how would you say that?  \\nS: Lo de Juan.  \\nT: Lo de Juan . Good. So, you could say I don’t want to speak about Juan’s business like this,  I don’t \\nwant to speak about Juan’s  business like this . And for Juan’s business you will just say:  \\nS: Lo de Juan.  \\nT: Good. So, I don’t want to speak about Juan’s business like this :  \\nS: No quiero hablar de lo de Juan así.  \\nT: Good. No quiero hablar de lo de Juan así . Or we could say no qu iero hablar sobre lo de Juan \\nasí, or just no quiero hablar lo de Juan así . So, lo de we kinda wanna see as a unit, meaning that \\nthing about . And we’ve seen already that de can mean about , so it’s just it about , that thing about . \\nIt’s used very often in Spa nish and you will find it very useful. So, you could say, for example, I \\nwant to organize that thing tomorrow. That thing tomorrow, that thing about tomorrow . I want to \\norganize , what’s to organize ?  \\nS: Organizar .  \\nT: Good. So, I want to organize that thin g about tomorrow :S: Quiero organizar lo de la mañana ?  \\nT: La mañana  is the morning .  \\nS: Oh, sorry, tomorrow .  \\nT: Yes, so morning  and tomorrow  are the same word in Spanish, mañana . If you say la mañana we \\nare going to understand the morning .  \\nS: So it’s j ust mañana .  \\nT: Good, so all together:  \\nS: Quiero organizar lo de mañana.  \\nT: Very good. Quiero organizar lo de mañana . It about tomorrow, the thing about tomorrow . \\nQuiero organizar lo de mañana . But I don’t want to organize it like this , but I don’t want to \\norganize it like this :  \\nS: Pero no quiero organizarlo así.  \\nT: Good. Pero no quiero organizarlo así.  Good. But I don't want to organize it like this . Or, if you \\nwanted to be more emphatic, you could replace así with de esta manera , de esta forma , of thi s \\nway, of this form , but así is the most common, you will be hearing it all the time.\",\n",
       " 'Track 58  \\nT: We have one more time in Spanish to learn, one more verb time, and that’s the point in the past. \\nThe one that usually we would express with -ed in English: wanted , walked , or, you know, the \\nirregular versions: ran, ate. This is the point in the past and it’s much more random than the other \\ntenses that we looked at. The point in the past is a little bit more messy, but we will find some \\nlogic in it, just not t he same one that we’ve been seeing until now. So, we will practice with hablar  \\nfor –ar verbs and with comer  for –er/-ir verbs, and we will use these verbs as our hooks that we \\ncan look back to when we need to remember one of these endings. So, I spoke , I spoke , is hablé , \\nhablé .  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Can you tell me what I did there then to get I spoke from to speak , from hablar ?  \\nS: You took off the –ar ending and added an /e/.  \\nT: Good. Anything else?  \\nS: Well, the accent  is on the / e/.  \\nT: Perfect. Hablé . Good.  So, that’s I spoke . And he/she/it or you (formal) spoke  is habló , habló .  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: Good. And what did I do there to get habló  from hablar ?  \\nS: You took off the –ar and you put an o.  \\nT: Okay, and  what else ?  \\nS: The accent is on the o.  \\nT: Good. So, r emember when we said how important the accent was in the present, because if you \\nstress HA-blo, I speak , if you stress it wrong we said that we will get this version in the past, \\nha-BLÓ ,  he/she/it  and you (formal) spoke . What was I didn’t speak :  \\nS: No habló . \\nT: IS: Ah, sorry, no hablé .  \\nT: No hablé . And that might happen to you often, because we have such strong connection between \\n/o/ and I, but in this point in the past it’s / e/. No hablé . And he didn’t speak or she didn’t speak or \\nyou (formal) didn’t speak :  \\nS: No habló.  \\nT: No habló . Good. What was to buy ?  \\nS: Comprir, comprar .  \\nT: Good, comprar . So if you come up with “comprir”, for example, and it doesn’t feel right, you can \\njust run a little check and change the ending: “comprir”, “comprer ”, comprar , and the one that \\nyou heard before is going to be the one that jumps out at you: comprar . So, how would you say I \\nbought ?  \\nS: Compré .  \\nT: Compré . And I bought it :  \\nS: Lo compré .  \\nT: Lo compré . I didn’t buy it :  \\nS: No lo compré .  \\nT: Good. No lo compré . He bought it :  \\nS: Lo compró .  \\nT: Lo compró . He bought it for me :  \\nS: Me lo compró .  \\nT: Good, we don’t need the for. Very good. Me lo compró . We could use the for, if we wanted, if we \\nwanted to emphasize or stress that it’s for me , so, how woul d that be?  \\nS: Lo compró para mi .  \\nT: Good. Lo compró para mi . To send in Spanish is enviar .S: Enviar .  \\nT: So we have envoy  from this in English.  \\nS: Envelope .  \\nT: Is that from there?  \\nS: Must be -  \\nT: Or is it from envelop , like to encapsulate , you hav e encapsulate , envelop . But, like I said we don’t \\nneed to know when we consider these things, just considering it helps us remember that word and \\nif you are particularly curious there are, I mean, to check, there are some very good online free \\nresources, f or example, etymonline.com, is an excellent free etymological dictionary, where you \\ncan check any word you have a curiosity for. So enviar , to send . I sent :  \\nS: Envié .  \\nT: Exactly. I sent it :  \\nS: Lo envié .  \\nT: I sent it to you , speaking informally:  \\nS: Te lo envié.  \\nT: Good. I didn’t send it to you :  \\nS: No te lo envié.  \\nT: Good. No te lo envié . The word for still or yet, the same word in Spanish, still or yet, is todavía , \\ntodavía .  \\nS: Todavía .  \\nT: Which is actually the combination of todo , here toda , in feminine, meaning all, and vía, like via \\nin English, is a way, so it’s “all the way”. But of course no Spanish speaker hears that, when they \\nhear todavía , just like when we say expressions like as well , we don’t think that that’s built of as \\nand well. So, the words, sometimes the small words we build these bigger words out of in English \\nand in Spanish, don’t make much sense to us most of the time, but for a learner it’s useful for youto divide a word like todavía , because it’s long and you might find it difficult to remember, and if \\nyou identify that it’s toda  and vía, even if that doesn’t really make any sense with the meaning of \\nyet and still, it’s gonna help you internalize that vocabulary. So, yet or still:  \\nS: Todavía .  \\nT: Todavía . I didn’t  send it to you yet , still speaking informally:  \\nS: No te lo envié todavía .  \\nT: Good. No te lo envié todavía . Good. What was he sent  or she sent  or you (formal) sent, it sent ?  \\nS: Envió .  \\nT: Good. Envió . Yesterday , the word for yesterday  was ayer, a-y-e-r.  \\nS: Ayer .  \\nT: Good. So, how would you say he sent it yesterday ?  \\nS: Lo envió ayer .  \\nT: Good. Lo envió ayer . He sent it yesterday, she sent it yesterday, you (formal) sent it yesterday . If \\nyou want to say it was sent yesterday , this kind of st ructure in English where we don’t say who \\ndid it, we just say it was sent yesterday , how do you think you might say that in Spanish?  \\nS: Se lo envié , no-  \\nT: Think first, the structure in English, what you will say in Spanish, but in English.  \\nS: It sent itself.   \\nT: Exactly. It sent itself. So what is it sent ?  \\nS: Envió .  \\nT: Okay, It sent itself :  \\nS: Se envió .  \\nT: Yes, and you are dying to put the lo there, right?  \\nS: Yes!T: So, this is the intuition because you have it sent in your mind, but  if you don’t succumb to that \\nintuition and you work mechanically it sent , envió , it sent itself , se envió , okay, then you don’t get \\nlo, because you don’t need it. So, it sent itself yesterday, it was sent yesterday:   \\nS: Se envió ayer .  \\nT: Good. Se envió a yer. Good. Again, what was to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Good, and I spoke :  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Good, and he spoke :  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: He spoke with me :  \\nS: Habló conmigo .  \\nT: Good. Habló conmigo . I don’t know why he didn’t speak with me . I don’t know why he didn’t  \\nspeak with me.  So, the first bit is I don’t know why :  \\nS: No sé por qué .  \\nT: He didn’t speak with me :  \\nS: No habló conmigo .  \\nT: Good. No sé por qué no habló conmigo . To forget  is olvidar , olvidar.   \\nS: Olvidar .  \\nT: That means to forget.  And the noun, olvid o, we don’t have it in English, I don’t think . The \\nforgetting , el olvido , the process , like the experience of forgetting, I don’t think we have a word \\nlike this in English, and you will hear it a lot in songs especially in Spanish, especially tango, if \\nyou listen to tangos, they speak about falling in love and forgetting, not ever falling out of love, \\nonly el olvido . Olvidar,  to forget . How would you say I forgot ?S: Olvidé .  \\nT: And he forgot :  \\nS: Olvidó .  \\nT: I was going to do it, but I forgot it . I was going to do it, but I forgot it . So, the first bit is I was \\ngoing , this is your line in the past, and it’s one of the three irregular verbs that we have in the line \\nof the past.  \\nS: Iba.  \\nT: Iba. So, I was going to do it :  \\nS: Lo iba a hacer.  \\nT: But I forgot it :  \\nS: Pero lo olvidé.  \\nT: Good. Lo iba a hacer pero lo olvidé . Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 59  \\nT: So, for –ar verbs we have / e/ for I: hablar  - to speak , hablé  – I spoke , and / o/ for he/she/it/you \\nformal and we are accenting our endings - hablé , habló . For –er/-ir verbs we have an / i/ sound, so \\nan i, an i, for I, and / ió/, i-o, for he/she/it . So we have / i/ and / ió/. So, if you go to comer  – to eat , \\nI ate is comí , and he ate/she ate/it ate/you (formal) ate is comió . We are accenting the endings \\nagain, the i and the o. Comí , comió .  \\nS: Comí , comió .  \\nT: Good. What was salir ? Salir :  \\nS: To leave ?  \\nT: To leave or to go out . So, how would you say I went out or I left?  \\nS: Salí.  \\nT: Salí. She went out, she left :  \\nS: Salió .  \\nT: Salió . Good. She didn’t go out y et, she didn’t leave yet :  \\nS: No salió todavía .  \\nT: Good. No salió todavía . I don’t know why she didn’t leave yet.  I don’t know why she didn’t leave \\nyet:  \\nS: No sé por qué no salió todavía .  \\nT: Good. No sé por qué no salió todavía . What did qué mean? Qué, what does that mean?  \\nS: What .  \\nT: Yes, what , and what else does it mean?  \\nS: That.T: That. In, like, I hope that , espero que , good. So, apart from what  and that, que also means than, \\nthan. So, you can use it like this, so you could say, for example, I ate more than him. I ate is the \\nfirst bit:  \\nS: Comé ?  \\nT: -er/-ir verb.  \\nS: Comí .  \\nT: Good. I ate more than him :  \\nS: Comí más que él .  \\nT: Good. Not him, than he . More than he ate . Comí más que él – I ate more than him , or more than \\nhe ate . Good. He ate mor e than me :  \\nS: Comió más que  … and I’m not sure if it’s “mi” or “migo”.  \\nT: When we said comí más que él , we put él there because whilst in English we say him, what we \\nreally mean is he. I ate more than he ate . It’s quite peculiar in English, that we say him and not he, \\nso in Spanish we are being more literal: comí más que él – I ate more than he . So, he ate more \\nthan me - Comió más que :  \\nS: Yo.  \\nT: Exactly. So, he ate more than I, he ate more than I ate.  So, how would that be?  \\nS: Comió más que yo .  \\nT: Goo d. Comió más que yo . It’s actually quite peculiar in English that we say me. In fact, the way \\nwe use words like me instead of I is really peculiar in English, and it’s a negative language transfer, \\nthat could influence other languages that you are learning . For example, if I say who wants to go \\nto the park , you might say me! This doesn’t make any sense. It’s I, I want to go to the park , what \\nis this me? So, there is some strange use of these words in English that might influence our Spanish, \\nso we need to c ut that negative language transfer when we identify it popping up. So, comió más \\nque yo , he ate more than I, he ate more than I ate . What was to see ?  \\nS: Ver.T: Ver. Good. I saw ? Ver is regular here, so I saw . So, go back to comer,  use that as your hoo k.  \\nS: Vi.  \\nT: Good. I saw him :  \\nS: Lo vi.  \\nT: Good . Lo vi. I didn’t see him :  \\nS: No lo vi.  \\nT: No lo vi. I saw him, but he didn’t see me.  And, as we are contrasting we will probably use one or \\nboth of the words for I and he, those words we don’t  need to use, we will probably use one or both \\nof them here as we’re contrasting, although you don’t need to, so it’s up to you. I saw him, but he \\ndidn’t see me . First bit is I saw him :  \\nS: Lo vi.  \\nT: But, he didn’t see me :  \\nS: Pero no me vio.  \\nT: Goo d. Lo vi, pero no me vio. And like I said, as we are contrasting we might feel an urge to say \\nthe word for él: lo vi, pero él no me vio or yo lo vi, pero él no me vio, depends on the context, \\neven if you have context and you know who you ar e talking about , you might feel yourself wanting \\nto say these words because you are contrasting. The word for nothing, nothing,  in Spanish is nada , \\nnada .  \\nS: Nada .  \\nT: N-a-d-a, nada .  \\nS: Nada .  \\nT: And we have double negative in Spanish, which means you ca n say I didn’t see nothing :  \\nS: No vi nada .  \\nT: Good. No vi nada . I didn’t eat anything :S: No comí nada .  \\nT: No comí nada . Didn’t you eat anything  (speaking formally) ? Didn’t you eat anything? :  \\nS: ¿No comió nada ?  \\nT: ¿No comió nada ? Why didn’t yo u eat anything? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no comió nada ?  \\nT: ¿Por qué no comió nada ? Good. The word for nobody  is nadie .  \\nS: Nadie .  \\nT: N-a-d-i-e, nadie .  \\nS: Nadie .  \\nT: Nobody saw anything, nobody saw nothing :  \\nS: Nadie vio nada .  \\nT: Good.  Nadie vio nada . Goo d. Nobody saw anything . Durar , durar, means to last . Durar.   \\nS: Durar .  \\nT: We have endure  in English.  \\nS: Duration ?  \\nT: Duration , and you even get like corporate names, that use these Latin roots and kind of appeal to \\nyour understanding without you realizi ng that you understand it. So, for example, you have \\nDuracell  batteries, you know what that means, but you don’t know why you know what it means, \\nso you can identify this kind of use of Latin in industry and how it’s appealing to your subconscious \\nundersta nding of the message that they want to give you about the products. So, look out for that. \\nSo, durar , to last . Minute  in Spanish is minuto . So, how would you say it lasted two minutes ? It \\nlasted two minutes :  \\nS: Duró dos minutos .  \\nT: Very good. Duró d os minutos . I lasted two minutes :S: Duré dos minutos .  \\nT: Good. Duré dos minutos . We looked at before how you can get this -ing adjective. So, the \\nadjective that we have for -ing, like interesting , using -ante or -iente . So, interesting  was \\ninteresante . So, during  is not an adjective, but it’s formed in the same way, so how do you think \\nyou say during  in Spanish?  \\nS: Durante ?  \\nT: Yes, durante . So you could say during two minutes:   \\nS: Durante dos minutos .  \\nT: Good. And you can use that like for, as well. S o, we said that with time you can say por dos \\nminutos , but you can also say durante,  you will hear that as well in Spanish, durante dos \\nminutos , during two minutes, for two minutes . What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . Good. And he ate :  \\nS: Comió .  \\nT: Comió . How would you say he ate for half  an hour , or he ate during half an hour - half an hour \\nis media , half, and what was hour ?  \\nS: Hora .  \\nT: Hora , like in ahora . Media hora . Good. So, he ate during half an hour, he ate for half an hour :  \\nS: Comió dura nte media hora .  \\nT: Good. Comió durante media hora . He spoke during half  an hour, for half an hour :  \\nS: Habló durante media hora .  \\nT: Habló durante media hora . What was with in Spanish?  \\nS: Con.  \\nT: Con. Without  in Spanish is sin. S-i-n, sin.S: Sin.  \\nT: Sin. And to stop, to stop, is parar , parar . P-a-r-a-r, parar .  \\nS: Parar .  \\nT: So you could say he spoke for half an hour without stopping . He spoke for half an hour without \\nstopping :  \\nS: Habló durante media hora sin parar .  \\nT: Good. Habló durante m edia hora sin parar . And we said that after prepositions, so sin is a \\npreposition, we are not saying stoppING , we are saying to stop – sin parar , “without to stop”. \\nHabló durante media hora sin parar . Parar  is interesting, because par, par, in Spanish mean s \\npair,  so un par is a pair . So, like a pair of shoes , un par de zapatos , un par de zapatos . So, \\nparar , to stop , might be “the pairing”, you can imagine this kind of time and space notion of two \\nthings pairing, reaching each other and then stopping. And th en comparar , to compare,  is “with \\npairing”. So, even though this is an m here, it’s con, the n has been softened by that p, which is \\nwhy we say compare . So, “with pairing” is to compare . Prepare , of course, is “pre -pairing”, we \\ncan see this in English as well. Repair,  to repair is to “re -pair”, to pair up again. Separar  is to \\nseparate in Spanish, separation , separación , separar ; and this se- means apart , so to separate is \\nto “pair apart”, to “pair apart ”.',\n",
       " \"Track 60  \\nT: What was to speak  in Spanish?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar . I spoke :  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Hablé . And he spoke/she spoke/you  (formal) spoke :  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: Habló . Good. We spoke  is hablamos,  which, I’m sure you’ve noticed, is exactly the same as the \\npresent, we speak . So, hablamos  means we speak or we spoke , which, for one side  is wonderful \\nbecause it means you get another version of this very irregular tense without having to remember \\na new one. But, of course, it can cause some ambiguity, and in real life it can cause some ambiguity, \\nnot often, mind, because most of the time you have some context showing that you are talking \\nabout the past. For example, the word for when  is cuando.   \\nS: Cuando .  \\nT: So, if you want to say when we speak  I understand everything,  what was to understand ?  \\nS: Comprender .  \\nT: Comprender . So, when we speak, I understand everything :  \\nS: Cuando hablamos, comprendo todo .  \\nT: Good. Cuando hablamos, comprendo todo . So, cuando hablamos , that bit could be when we \\nspeak , generally , or when we spoke , so that second half brings us into the context and we \\nunderstand that when we speak , generally speaking, I understand everything. Cuando hablamos, \\ncomprendo todo . But, if you wanted to say when we spoke I understood everything , then, of \\ncourse, the first bit is going to be the same, but tha t second bit, I understood everything , is going \\nto give you that context. So, let’s practice that one - when we spoke I understood everything :  \\nS: Cuando hablamos, comprendí todo .T: Very good. Cuando hablamos, comprendí todo . So again, the second part of  that sentence is \\nmaking it clear whether this hablamos  is the present or the past. Cuando hablamos, comprendo \\ntodo; cuando hablamos, comprendí todo . We spoke yesterday.  We spoke yesterday :  \\nS: Hablamos ayer.   \\nT: Hablamos ayer . Good. And we know that we ca n use the present with future context in Spanish.  \\nSo, if you wanted to say we will speak tomorrow :  \\nS: Hablamos mañana .  \\nT: Hablamos mañana . So, hablamos ayer , we spoke yesterday ; hablamos mañana , we will speak \\ntomorrow . How would you say we wait a lot , we wait a lot , generally ? What is a lot in Spanish?  \\nS: Mucho .  \\nT: Good. To wait or to hope :  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: Esperar . If you forget this one you can think of desperate,  which means “un -hoped”. Desesperado  \\nin Spanish, again one of these -ado/-ido adjectives from the version that comes after haber.  You \\ncan see desesperar  – desesperado,  which made desperate.  And it’s desesperado  in Spanish, not \\n“desperado”, like we have some spanishisms, let’s say, that have entered English, but they can \\nenter incorrect ly, like “desperado” is desesperado  in Spanish; or in English you might hear “no \\nproblemo”, this is loosely based on Spanish, but of course, problem  in Spanish is problema,  not \\n“problemo”, and actually you would say ningun problema , not “no problema”. So, esperar , to \\nwait or to hope . So, talking generally, we wait a lot, we wait around a lot :  \\nS: Esperamos mucho .  \\nT: Esperamos mucho . Maybe you meant yesterday, here it might be ambiguous, unless the context \\nis clear. So, if you want to clarify, you might wan t to say the word yesterday.  How would you say \\nwe waited a lot yesterday ?  \\nS: Esperamos mucho ayer .  \\nT: Good. Esperamos mucho ayer . What was to eat ?S: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . And what is we eat ?  \\nS: Comemos .  \\nT: Comemos . We ate is comimos , comimos . We at e:  \\nS: Comimos .  \\nT: We didn’t eat :  \\nS: No comimos .  \\nT: No comimos . What was to live ?  \\nS: Vivir .  \\nT: And we live  (generally):  \\nS: Vivimos .  \\nT: And we lived :  \\nS: Vivimos .  \\nT: Vivimos . So, what this means is that because of this one difference we have in th e entire language \\nbetween -er and -ir verbs, in the present we have -emos for -er and -imos for -ir, what that means \\nis that when we go into the past, -ir verbs stay the same, vivimos -vivimos,  but –er verbs are \\ndifferent: comemos -comimos.  So, what was to see?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: And we see , in the present?  \\nS: Vemos .  \\nT: Vemos . And we saw :  \\nS: Vimos .  \\nT: Vimos . Good. What was to go out or to leave ?S: Salir .  \\nT: Good. We are going out , or we are leaving :  \\nS: Salimos .  \\nT: Good. And we went out or we left :  \\nS: Salimos .  \\nT: The same. What was to lose ?  \\nS: Perder .  \\nT: Perder . We lose :  \\nS: Perdemos .  \\nT: Good. We lost :  \\nS: Perdimos .  \\nT: Good. How would you say we got lost or we lost ourselves ?  \\nS: Nos perdimos .  \\nT: Nos perdimos . Good. Okay, so how would you say we always get lost, but we didn’t get lost \\nyesterday ? First thing - what was the word for always ?  \\nS: Siempre .  \\nT: Siempre . So, how would you say we always get lost ?  \\nS: Siempre perdemos… Siempre nos perdemos .  \\nT: Good. Siempre nos perdemos , or nos perdemos siempre . But:  \\nS: Pero .  \\nT: We didn’t get lost yesterday :  \\nS: No perdimos… No nos perdimos ayer .T: Good. Nos perdemos siempre, pero no nos perdimos ayer . Very good. There we see in that \\nsentence, perdemos  for present and perdimos  for past. But, of course, with -ir verbs, they have \\nthe same version for both. So, we could say, for example, we don’t go out often, but we went out \\nyesterday . And often  is a menudo , a menudo . Menudo  is like a literary word that's not used very \\noften for small,  related t o minute,  actually, or miniscule,  it’s not used very often in that sense, in \\nthe sense of small . But a menudo is used very often to mean often.  So, we don’t go out often :  \\nS: No salimos a menudo .  \\nT: But we went out yesterday :  \\nS: Pero salimos ayer.  \\nT: Go od, very good. So, here we have the present and the past in this sentence and we see that both \\nof them are salimos.  No salimos a menudo, pero salimos ayer . Let’s make a re cap. So, let’s do \\nit with hablar  and comer,  which we will use as our hook verbs. So,  I spoke :  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: He spoke :  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: We spoke :  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: And comer is to eat . So, I ate:  \\nS: Comí .  \\nT: He ate :  \\nS: Comió .  \\nT: We ate :  \\nS: Comimos .  \\nT: Very good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 61  \\nT: You remember how to say to call ? You need to open the assoc iation between to call  and to phone  \\nand to call myself , my name is , and then you remember it.  \\nS: Llamar .  \\nT: Yes. Llamar . Now we can look a little bit at how the line in the past and the dot in the past interact. \\nNow, we do this in some very common struct ures in both languages. For example, you might say \\nsomething like I was cooking when the phone rang . So, I was cooking when the phone rang , which \\npart is the line? And which part is the point?  \\nS: I was cooking  is the line.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: The phone rang  is the dot.  \\nT: Good. So, let’s begin with I was cooking . What is to cook ?  \\nS: Cocinar .  \\nT: Cocinar . Good. I was cooking :  \\nS: Cocinaba .  \\nT: When :  \\nS: Cuando .  \\nT: Cuando . The phone rang . El teléfono is the phone , like in English, which is actually from Greek . \\nThis first bit, tele-, means far, distant,  and phone  means voice.  It’s the “distant voice ”, it’s the \\ntelephone . So when the phone rang , and we will say when the phone sounded . And to sound  is \\nsonar.  Sonar . So when the phone sounded :  \\nS: Cuando el teléfon o sonó .  \\nT: All together, I was cooking when the phone rang.  Not from memory but thinking it through again. \\nI was cooking when the phone rang :S: Cocinaba cuando el teléfono sonó.  \\nT: Very good. Cocinaba cuando el teléfono sonó , or cocinaba cuando sonó el  teléfono , which \\nwould probably be more natural order in Spanish. Cocinaba cuando sonó el teléfono . But both \\norders are perfectly fine. To arrive  was llegar . Llegar , to arrive .  \\nS: Llegar .  \\nT: And this is l-l, so we have the double l, which is like a y sound, e-g-a-r. –ar verb, llegar.   \\nS: Llegar .  \\nT: I arrived :  \\nS: Llegué .  \\nT: Llegué . He arrived :  \\nS: Llegó .  \\nT: Llegó . We arrived :  \\nS: Llegamos .  \\nT: Llegamos . Good. I was speaking on the phone when Maria arrived.  And we’re not going to say \\nliterally on the ph one in Spanish. We will say por, por teléfono , by phone . Por can also mean by.  \\nSo I was speaking on the phone when Maria arrived :  \\nS: Hablaba por teléfono cuando María llegó .  \\nT: Very good. Hablaba por teléfono cuando María llegó . Or hablaba por teléfono cuando llegó \\nMaría . Either way. Good. So we can see how we’re using the line and the point together. If you \\nwere to look up to stay  in the dictionary, you would find quedarse.  Then, you need to do something \\nwith that se so if you wanted to say I stayed , how would it be?  \\nS: Me quedé .  \\nT: Me quedé . He stayed ? Or she stayed , or you (formal) stayed , it stayed :  \\nS: Se quedó .T: Se quedó . And we stayed :  \\nS: Nos quedamos.  \\nT: Nos quedamos . Which, of course, could also mean we stay  or we are staying.  Good. What w as to \\nplease ? The verb that we use to express like. To please :  \\nS: Gustar .  \\nT: Gustar . Good. And if you want to say I like it , you say it pleases me.  So how do you say I like it ?  \\nS: Me gusto. Me lo gusto .  \\nT: We’re working on intuition, no? We’ve got me and it and we’re throwing it all in there. But we \\nmust -  \\nS: Sorry, me gusta .  \\nT: Yes. We must process it literally. It pleases me.  It pleases , gusta.  It pleases me , me gusta . Good.  \\nNow if you want to say I liked it , you just say, of course, it pleased me . So how would that be?  \\nS: “Me gusté .” Sorry, me gustó .  \\nT: Me gustó . Good. Me gusté , what does that mean? Me gusté ?  \\nS: I pleased myself.   \\nT: I liked myself.  Ah? Me gustó , it pleased me , I liked it.  Good. I didn’t like it :  \\nS: No me gustó .  \\nT: No me gust ó. I didn’t like it , it didn’t please me . Apart from the point in the past, you could also \\nuse the line in the past here depending on the context. So how would you say that? It wasn’t \\npleasing me :  \\nS: No me gustaba .  \\nT: No me gustaba . So with this line and  point, we’re not looking for direct translations from English. \\nWe are looking to understand the concept of the line in time and the point in time and applying it \\ndirectly in Spanish. Because in English you would never say something like I wasn’t liking it . Anda lot of the time it’s totally interchangeable in Spanish. No me gustó , no me gustaba , just means \\nyou’re thinking in a different way when you say it. No me gustó , you’re referring to something as \\nan event, as something closed. And no me gustaba , you’ re thinking about something as an ongoing \\nthing that occurred over a period of time. Really, a lot of the time that difference between the point \\nand the line in time just originates in the mind. Parecer , parecer , was to seem . Parecer .  \\nS: Parecer .  \\nT: It’s  related to apparent  and we have aparecer  in Spanish, which means to appear .  \\nS: Is transparent  similar?  \\nT: Transparent  also is related, yes of course. Good. So parecer  is to seem . How would you say it \\nseems to me ? It seems to me :  \\nS: Me parece .  \\nT: Good. It seems good to me , or in Spanish it seems well to me :  \\nS: Me parece bien .  \\nT: Me parece bien . How would you say it seemed good to me ?  \\nS: Me parecí .  \\nT: It seemed :  \\nS: Ah, yes of course. Me pareció bien.   \\nT: Good. Me pareció bien . It seemed good to me.  And you might want to use the line in the past. \\nYou might want to say, like, it was seeming good to me.  So even though this is not a translation \\nyou would use in English, in Spanish you’re just thinking about do I mean a point in time or do I \\nmean o ngoing in this context? So we might want it was seeming to me well.  How would you say \\nthat?  \\nS: Parecer  becomes parecía.  Me parecía bien .  \\nT: Good. Me parecía bien . It seemed good to me, but when I saw it I didn’t like it . So it seemed good \\nto me , it was s eeming good to me :S: Me parecía bien .  \\nT: But:  \\nS: Pero .  \\nT: When I saw it :  \\nS: Cuando lo vi.   \\nT: I didn’t like it :  \\nS: No me gustó.   \\nT: Very good. Me parecía bien , pero cuando lo vi , no me gustó . And again, here we see the \\ninteraction, no? Between the l ine and the point. Me parecía bien , it was seeming ok, fine, to me , \\npero cuando lo vi , but when I saw it , this is a very clear point in the past, I didn’t like it , in that \\nmoment when I saw it I didn’t like it . Again the point in the past. Me parecía bien , pero cuando \\nlo vi, no me gustó . Excellent.',\n",
       " 'Track 62  \\nT: What was to give  in Spanish?  \\nS: Dar.  \\nT: Dar. Good. Now dar is irregular in this point in the past, in that whilst it’s an -ar verb it behaves \\nlike an -er/-ir verb. It’s the only verb that has th is particular peculiarity, the only verb that just \\nswitches sides like this in this point in the past. So, how would you say I gave ?  \\nS: Di.  \\nT: Di. Good. D-i, di. And he gave , she gave , it gave , you (formal) gave :  \\nS: Dío.  \\nT: And where is the accent?  \\nS: Sorry, dio.  \\nT: Dio. Good. Dio. We gave :  \\nS: Dimos .  \\nT: Dimos . Good. How would you say he gave me ?  \\nS: Me dio .  \\nT: Good. Me dio . And he gave me it :  \\nS: Me lo dio .  \\nT: Me lo dio . He gave us it , he gave it to us :  \\nS: Nos lo dio .  \\nT: Good. Nos lo dio . He didn’t give it to us :  \\nS: No nos lo dio .  \\nT: Good. No nos lo dio . I gave it to you  (speaking informally) I gave you it , I gave it to you :  \\nS: Did we do it?T: I gave :  \\nS: Ah, I gave .  \\nT: So your mind went to you gave , ah?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: So how do you  control that, how do you stop that happening?  \\nS: Cutting it up.  \\nT: Ok, so your first thought, what is it? Your first thought when you want to build I gave you it , I \\ngave it to you .  \\nS: I gave .  \\nT: Exactly. And then the rest flows off. So I gave y ou it, speaking informally?  \\nS: Te lo di .  \\nT: Te lo di . Good. So it’s not a new thing for us to have two of these small words together, nos lo , te \\nlo, me lo . What we didn’t see so far is having two words together, two of these small words \\ntogether, where both of them begin with l. That’s because in Spanish, when that happens, a \\nphonetic change occurs. So for example, if I wanted to say I gave it to him , it should be le lo di . \\nBut - and this isn’t about grammar, it’s about phonetics, it’s about sound  - Spanish doesn’t like \\nthat. Spanish doesn’t like the sound of those two l’s together: le lo. Doesn’t like it. So where we \\nwould have le lo, les lo , les los , le los , any combination of / l/-/l/ together with these small words, \\nthe first one is going to turn int o se. So another se. Ah? But a totally different use, and it’s not \\nchanging any meaning, it’s just a phonetic issue. So this means that le lo, les lo , become se lo. So \\nhow would you say I gave it to him ?  \\nS: Se lo di .  \\nT: Good. Se lo di . How would you sa y I gave it to you guys  or to them ?  \\nS: Se lo di .T: Se lo di . The same. So it is really just a phonetic change. It’s got nothing to do with the different \\nmeanings that we saw for se, like himself  and herself  that we saw before. Ah? It’s just a phonetic  \\nchange because Spanish doesn’t like having these two l’s together. Se lo di : I gave it to you guys ,  \\nI gave it to them , I gave it to him , I gave it to her , I gave it to you (formal). How would you say I \\ngave them to him ?  \\nS: Se los di .  \\nT: Perfect. Well  done. Se los di . So, of course this means that there could be many ambiguities. So \\nnow is a good time to look at how we can make these clarifications. Generally, not just in this \\nstructure, but generally. So for example, how would you say I gave him somet hing? I gave him \\nsomething :  \\nS: Le di algo .  \\nT: Le di algo . So in this case, we might want to clarify as well, because of course le di algo could \\nmean I gave him something , I gave her something , I gave you (formal) something . So how do we \\nmake that clari fication? It’s simple. We repeat the whole sentence, and then we say afterwards to \\nhim, to her . For example, le di algo a él , le di algo a ella . How would you clarify I gave something \\nto you , speaking formally ?  \\nS: Le di algo a usted .  \\nT: Good. Le di a lgo a usted . So actually, we’re repeating, no? We don’t get rid of that le because we \\nput a usted , which is excellent for the learner. Because it means you don’t have to worry about \\nchanging the structure of the sentence when you’re clarifying, using this a to clarify, because \\nyou’re repeating. Now, we saw before we didn’t have this situation. For example, we could say \\nme lo compra , he buys it for me , or lo compra para mí . We don’t repeat the me there. But with \\nthis a, with this a that we use to clarify, we  will always repeat. Le di algo a él . It’s like an \\nafterthought. Le di algo a ella . You don’t have to go back and restructure because you’ve made \\nthat clarification. So going back to this situation when we have two /l/’s together, what was to sell ?  \\nS: Vender .  \\nT: Vender . And how would you say I sold ?S: Vendí .  \\nT: Vendí . And I sold it :  \\nS: Lo vendí .  \\nT: Lo vendí . And I sold him it :  \\nS: L- … se lo vendí .  \\nT: Very good. It would be le lo vendí , but we don’t like this sound in Spanish, so we just say se lo \\nvendí . But of course, se lo vendí is very ambiguous. Most of the time we’re going to know what \\nwe’re talking about because of the context. Usually when we’re speaking we mentioned already \\nwhat or who we’re speaking about. But if you want to clarify it, if you want to be emphatic, you \\ncan add on afterwards to him . So, how would you do that? I sold it to him :  \\nS: Se lo vendí a él .  \\nT: Good. So we’re just repeating. Se lo vendí a él . This is probably because this a is actually quite \\nflexible. We can use it to clarify, but not just for the preposition to. For example, if I say me lo \\ncompra a mí , and I use this a to emphasize mí, a mí, to me  literally, could mean from me , he buys \\nit from me . Or it could mean for me , he buys it for me . Me lo compra a mí . So thi s a is a bit special. \\nWe’re using it to clarify and it can replace or represent other prepositions, other than to, which is \\nits literal translation. And because it has this special use, we are always repeating with  \\na. Whereas, as we saw before, with the o ther prepositions, we are not repeating. Me lo compra, \\nlo compra para mí.  No repetition there. But if we use a to make this clarification, we repeat. Me \\nlo compra a mí . Ah? So you repeat. Se lo vendí a él . How would you say I sold it to her ?  \\nS: Se lo vendí a ella.  \\nT: Se lo vendí a ella . What if you wanted to say I sold them to her ?  \\nS: Se los vendí a ella .  \\nT: Very good. Se los vendí a ella . What if they were feminine things that you sold to her?  \\nS: Se las vendí a ella.T: Good. Se las vendí a ella. So what if actually you sold them  to them,  not to her? So now, we’re \\ngoing to say I sold them , those feminine things, to them , mixed or masculine group.  \\nS: Se los vendí -  \\nT: Feminine things.  \\nS: Sorry, se las vendí a ellos .  \\nT: Se las vendí a ellos . Good. What was to send ?  \\nS: Enviar .  \\nT: Enviar . Good. How would you say he sent ?  \\nS: Envió .  \\nT: Envió . He sent me it :  \\nS: Me lo envió.  \\nT: Good. He sent us it :  \\nS: Nos le - sorry - nos lo envió .  \\nT: Nos lo envió . he sent you it  (speaking informally):  \\nS: Te lo envió.   \\nT: Perfect. Te lo envió . So we have no problem with me lo , nos lo , te lo, but of course we can’t have \\nle lo. So if you want to say he sent it to her , how will it be?  \\nS: Se lo envió.  \\nT: Good. You want to clarify, go ahead.  \\nS: A ella .  \\nT: Good. Se lo envió a ella . And of course we could clarify he as well. Él se lo envió a ella . So it’s \\nlike you have this base structure, se lo envió , and you can clarify around it. Él se lo envió . Se lo \\nenvió a ella.  Él se lo envió a ella . But what is not changing there is that bit, se lo envió . He sent \\nit to them :S: Se lo envió a ellos.  \\nT: Good. And what if it was to you guys ? He sent it to you guys :  \\nS: Se lo envió a ustedes.  \\nT: Good. Se lo envió a ustedes . He didn’t send it to you guys yet . He didn ’t send it to you guys yet:   \\nS: It’s no se lo envió a ustedes … and I forgot yet.  \\nT: “All way”.  \\nS: Ah, todavía .  \\nT: Todavía . Good. So, no se lo envió a ustedes todavía . No se lo envió todavía a ustedes , could go \\nthat way around as well. I don’t know if I sent it to him, I don’t know if I sent it to him:   \\nS: No sé si envié – lo envié – se lo envié.  \\nT: Good. No sé si se lo envié . Excellent. So when we’re using this a for clarification or emphasis, we \\nare repeating. Se lo envié a él . Se lo compré a ella . So we repeat when we’re using this a for \\nemphasis or for clarification. But if we use another preposition, like para  for example, lo compré \\npara usted , lo compré para ti . Then we don’t repeat. So these very specific details of language, \\nI don’t want anybody t o worry or stress about remembering or memorizing them. Remember, as \\nlong as you are actively listening and analyzing the Spanish that you expose yourself to, even if \\nyou forget it now, you will notice it again for yourself through listening, analyzing, co mparing, \\nwith the skills that we’ve developed during this course. So our focus is to understand it, not to \\nmemorize it.',\n",
       " 'Track 63  \\nT: To remember  in Spanish, to remember  in Spanish is acordarse . Acordarse . So it’s acordar . It \\njust means, this -se on the en d, just means that when we use this verb we need to say I remember \\nmyself to give the meaning of I remember . So how would you say I remember ?  \\nS: Is it acuerdo ?  \\nT: Good. The -o splits.  \\nS: It’s, uh...  yeah.  \\nT: So, I remember :  \\nS: Me acuerdo .  \\nT: Me acu erdo . I don’t remember :  \\nS: No me acuerdo.  \\nT: No me acuerdo . I don’t remember.  No me acuerdo . Good. So, I don’t remember if I gave it to \\nhim or to her. I don’t remember if I gave it to him or to her . So, I don’t remember :  \\nS: No me - no me acuerdo.  \\nT: If I gave it to him or to her :  \\nS: Si lo- si se lo di a él o ella.  \\nT: Or to her :  \\nS: O a ella.  \\nT: Good. No me acuerdo si se lo di a él o a ella . Very good. How would you say we don’t remember \\nif we gave it to him or to them ? And we mean feminine them . So, we don’t remember is the first \\nbit:  \\nS: No nos acordamos.  \\nT: Good. No nos acordamos because here we are not stressing the -o. It’s not going to split. No nos \\nacordamos . If:S: Si.  \\nT: We gave it to him or to them  (female group):  \\nS: Lo dimos , isn’t that  right?  \\nT: The to when we actually say to him or to them is the clarification. It’s the repetition.  \\nS: Se lo dimos.  \\nT: To him or to them . Feminine them :  \\nS: A él o a ellas.  \\nT: Good. So all together. We don’t remember if we gave it to him or to them  (feminine):  \\nS: No acordamos.  \\nT: Where is the se in no acordamos ? Where is the se of acordarse?   \\nS: No nos acordamos.  \\nT: It became nos.  \\nS: Si se lo dimos a él o a ellas.  \\nT: Well done. No nos acordamos si se lo dimos a él o a ellas . What was he likes it , it is pleasing to \\nhim?  \\nS: Le lo gusta.  \\nT: Make sure you take the mid road until you are extremely comfortable with how gustar  works.  \\nTake the mid road of it is pleasing to him :  \\nS: Ah, le gusta.  \\nT: Good. Le gusta . She likes it :  \\nS: La gusta . No, le gusta.  \\nT: Le gusta . It’s still to her . It is pleasing to her . Le gusta . So le gusta could mean he likes it, she \\nlikes it . What else could it mean? It is pleasing to  who else?S: Usted .  \\nT: Good. So maybe here you want to clarify le gusta , it’s not very ob vious who you mean. By the \\ncontext it might be, but we’re seeing especially with this group of he, she, and it and usted  all \\ntogether , many times we are wanting to clarify. So bearing in mind that the structure is it is pleasing \\nto him, it is pleasing to h er, it is pleasing to you, how are you going to clarify? If you want to \\nclarify that you mean she likes it :  \\nS: Le gusta a ella.  \\nT: A ella . Good. So this is why it’s important to take that mid translation as well. Otherwise you \\nwould probably just say ella le gusta , which would mean she’s pleasing to whoever that  le is. We \\nwould just understand that somebody likes her. She is pleasing to , ah? So, to make it clear we need \\nto put the a. Le gusta a ella . A ella le gusta . To her it is pleasing. It is pleasi ng to her .  \\nAnd if we wanted to say he liked it , it was pleasing to him :  \\nS: So it’s gustó.   \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Le gustó.  \\nT: So this could mean it was pleasing to him, it was pleasing to her , it was pleasing to  you (formal), \\ncould be any combination of he, she, it, or you (formal) liking . He, she, it or you (formal ). So how \\nwould you clarify? How would you say it was pleasing to her ? She liked it, it was pleasing to her :  \\nS: Le gustó a ella.  \\nT: Le gustó a ella . Good.',\n",

Now hace,  you can use like ago. Like in English when you say two weeks ago , you \\ncan say it makes two weeks  in Spanish, and you get that meanin g. So week  is semana.  Two is - do \\nyou remember two?   \\nS: Dos.  \\nT: Dos. So two weeks ago , you will say it makes two weeks :  \\nS: Hace dos semanas.  \\nT: Hace dos semanas . I saw him two weeks ago :  \\nS: Lo vi hace dos semanas.  \\nT: Good. Lo vi hace dos semanas . Good. To respond is responder.  Responder . How would you say \\nI responded ?  \\nS: Respondí .  \\nT: Respondí . How would you say I responded to her ?  \\nS: La respondí . Le. Le respondí.  \\nT: Good. Le respondí . I responded to her. I responded to her seven weeks a go. Do you remember \\nhow to say seven?  Related to September :  \\nS: Siete .  \\nT: Siete . Good. So I responded to her seven weeks ago :  \\nS: Le respondí hace siete semanas.T: Good. Le respondí hace siete semanas.  Now in Spanish, you can say I responded her it.  For \\nexample, I responded to her letter or I responded to her mail . Instead of saying it this way, to her \\nmail, in Spanish you can just say I responded him the mail . I responded her the mail . Or if you \\nknow what you are talking about, I responded him it. I r esponded her it . This is because, and \\nsomething we’ll look at again later, Spanish does not use possessive words as much as English \\ndoes. So, it would be much more natural in Spanish, I responded her the mail . I responded him the \\nmail, instead of I respond ed to her mail . So how would you say I responded her it , which isn’t \\ngreat English, but it’s perfect Spanish ?  \\nS: Se lo respondí.  \\nT: Good. Se lo respondí . So the se is actually le, to her . The lo is el mail and you get se lo respondí . \\nI responded to he r the mail . Good. Month  is mes.  Mes. M-e-s.  \\nS: Mes.  \\nT: It’s a masculine word, so how would you say the month ?  \\nS: El mes.  \\nT: Good, and how would you say a month or one month ?  \\nS: Un mes.  \\nT: Un mes . So un mes can be a month or one month . So how wou ld you say I responded it to her one \\nmonth ago ? I responded to her mail, I responded her it one month ago :  \\nS: Se lo respondí hace un mes.  \\nT: Good. Se lo respondí hace un mes . Good. So we have respondí . I responded . How would you \\nsay he, she, it, you (formal) responded ?  \\nS: Respondió .  \\nT: Good. Respondió . And we responded :  \\nS: Respondimos .  \\nT: Good. Respondimos . So respondí,  respondió,  respondimos.  Let’s make a quick recap with an -ar \\nverb. How would you say discrimination ?S: Descriminación .  \\nT: Ag ain?  \\nS: Descriminación .  \\nT: In English we say discrimination  or descrimination?   \\nS: Oh, it’s with an i, yeah.  \\nT: It’s with an i, right?  \\nS: Yeah, discriminación .  \\nT: Discriminación . To discriminate :  \\nS: Discriminar .  \\nT: Discriminar . I discriminated :  \\nS: Discriminé .  \\nT: Discriminé . He, or she, or it, you (formal)  discriminated :  \\nS: Discriminó .  \\nT: Good. And we discriminated :  \\nS: Discriminamos .  \\nT: Good. So we have two more people to learn for the point in the past. They  and you informal. Let’s \\nbegin with you informal. For you informal, in the point in the past we have -aste for -ar verbs and \\n-iste for -er/-ir verbs. -aste for -ar verbs and -iste for -er/-ir verbs. So how would you say you \\nspoke , speaking informally?  \\nS: Hablaste .  \\nT: Hablaste . And you ate , speaking informally:  \\nS: Comiste .  \\nT: Good. Comiste . Did you eat? :S: ¿Comiste ?  \\nT: ¿Comiste ? Didn’t you eat? :  \\nS: ¿No comiste ?  \\nT: ¿No comiste ? Didn’t you eat it? :  \\nS: ¿No lo comiste?   \\nT: ¿No lo comiste ? Good. What was to leave or to go out ?  \\nS: Salir .  \\nT: Salir . How would you say did you go out? Did you leave? :  \\nS: ¿Saliste ?  \\nT: ¿Saliste ? Good. You didn’t go out last night? Last night  is anoche.  Anoche .  \\nS: Anoche .  \\nT: Now if you translate tonight  directly, what you will come up with is anoche.  So you must be \\ncareful not to get confused here. How do you say tonight  in Spanish?  \\nS: Esta noche.  \\nT: Esta noche . “This night”. So anoche  is last night , not tonight . So how would you say did you go \\nout last night ( speaking informally )?  \\nS: ¿Saliste anoche ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Saliste anoche ? Didn’t you go out last night? :  \\nS: ¿No saliste anoche ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ No saliste anoche ? What was to live ?  \\nS: Vivir .  \\nT: Vivir . And how do you say where ?  \\nS: Donde .T: Donde . Where did you live? :  \\nS: ¿Dónde viviste ?  \\nT: ¿Dónde viviste ? Where were you living? :  \\nS: So that’s the line. ¿Dónde vivías?   \\nT: Good. ¿ Dónde vivías ? So in many cases both line and point are perfectly fine. ¿ Dónde viviste ? \\n¿Dónde vivías ? All that means is that the speaker has  two different ideas in their mind. Maybe \\nyou go abroad to study and I’ll tell you ¿dónde viviste ? Or maybe I’ll tell you ¿dónde vivías ?  \\n¿Dónde viviste ? Where did you live? And this idea in my mind which is this closed  amount of \\ntime. Where were you living? just means the idea in my mind is an ongoing idea of time. So many \\ntimes it is completely interchangeable. What was to wait ?  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: Esperar . Esperar . So for you informal, we have -aste for the point in the past. So how would you \\nsay you waited , speaking informally ?  \\nS: Esperaste .  \\nT: Esperaste . Good. Did you wait for me? :  \\nS: ¿Me esperaste ?  \\nT: ¿Me esperaste ? Didn’t you wait for me? :  \\nS: ¿No me esperaste ?  \\nT: Why didn’t you wait for me? :  \\nS: ¿Por qué no me  esperaste ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Por qúe no me esperaste ? What was to arrive ?  \\nS: Llegar .  \\nT: Llegar . Good. How do you say when did you arrive? When did you arrive?  (informally):  \\nS: ¿Cuándo llegaste ?T: Good. ¿Cuándo llegaste ? This is an example of when you woul d need the point, because you \\nprobably wouldn’t want to say when were you arriving , no? So here’s very strongly the point in \\ntime. When did you arrive? ¿ Cuándo llegaste ? So we have -aste and -iste for you informal. For \\nthey,  we have -aron  for -ar verbs and  -ieron  for -er/-ir verbs. So, how would you say they spoke ? \\nThey spoke :  \\nS: Hablaron .  \\nT: Hablaron . They waited :  \\nS: Esperaron .  \\nT: Good. They prepared it :  \\nS: Lo prepararon.  \\nT: Lo prepararon . Good. We have -aron  for -ar verbs and -ieron,  i-e-r-o-n, for -er/-ir verbs. How \\nwould you say they ate ?  \\nS: Comieron .  \\nT: Comieron . They left, they went out :  \\nS: Salieron .  \\nT: Salieron . They sold them :  \\nS: Los vendieron .  \\nT: Good. Los vendieron . Good. So let’s have a quick review of the panorama of this poi nt in the past \\nwith hablar  and comer  which we might want to use as our hooks. So we’ll begin with hablar.  \\nHow do you say I spoke ?  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Hablé . He spoke :  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: Habló . We spoke :S: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . You spoke  (informal):  \\nS: Hablas te.  \\nT: Hablaste . And they spoke :  \\nS: Hablaron .  \\nT: Hablaron . Good. Hablé, habló, hablamos, hablaste, hablaron . Now let’s do the same for comer,  \\nso for -er/-ir verbs. How do you say I ate?  \\nS: Comí .  \\nT: Comí . He, she, it, you (formal) ate:  \\nS: Comió .  \\nT: Comió . We ate :  \\nS: Comemos .  \\nT: That’s the present.  \\nS: Comimos .  \\nT: Comimos . Good. You ate  (informally):  \\nS: Comiste .  \\nT: Comiste . And they ate :  \\nS: Comieron .  \\nT: Comieron . So what’s very interesting here is that for  -er/-ir verbs in the present, we had /e/ popping \\nup everywhere. Vive,  viven,  vives  and just one / i/. Just one / i/ sound. Just one i popping up, \\nvivimos.  But everything else was / e/ for -er/-ir verbs in the present, but in the past for  -er/-ir verbs \\nwe have i dominating the stage. We have the i, /i/ sound everywhere and this time the letter e, the \\n/e/ sound, occupying only one space. Popping up in only one place which is -ieron.  Comí , comió , \\ncomiste , comimos , comieron , which is the exact inverse of what happens in the present tense. Wecan see also a logic that crosses over between the -ar group and the -er/-ir group. For example, we \\nhave I spoke , how is it?  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Hablé . And he spoke :  \\nS: Habló .  \\nT: Habló . We saw the  -er/-ir in this past point has a special affiliation to the / i/ sound, the i, the letter \\ni. So whilst we have hablé  for -ar verbs, for -er/-ir verbs what do we have? How would we say I \\nate?  \\nS: Comí .  \\nT: Comí . And whilst we have habló  for -ar verbs, what do we have for -er/-ir verbs? How would you \\nsay he ate ?  \\nS: Com ió.  \\nT: Comió . So it’s like the -ar version, but with that important / i/ popping up again. We have, for we \\nspoke , what do we have?  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . And for we ate :  \\nS: Comimos .  \\nT: Comimos . That important / i/, the i, the / i/ sound again. For you (informal) spoke,  what do we have?  \\nS: Hablaste .  \\nT: Hablaste . But you ate :  \\nS: Comiste .  \\nT: Comiste . You remember ed the importance of that i. Comiste . They spoke :  \\nS: Hablaron .  \\nT: Hablaron . And they ate :S: Comieron .  \\nT: Comieron . Again that important i and that e getting just one small look in, in that dot in the past \\nto remind us that this is -er/-ir group, not just -ir. Just as what happened the other way around in \\nthe present. Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 65  \\nT: What was the word for nothing ?  \\nS: Nada .  \\nT: Nada . And nobody :  \\nS: Nadie .  \\nT: Yes, nadie.  What was the word for more,  like in “more late” or later?   \\nS: Más.  \\nT: Más.  \\nS: Más tarde .  \\nT: Good. So if you add más to nada  or nadie  you get else.

And you also have the t in there,  \\nS: Ah, comiste.   \\nT: Good. Which also relates to you informal, that t, but in a different way. But they’re both in there \\nand they will help you remember that ending, comiste.  Didn’t you eat anything else? :  \\nS: ¿No comiste nada más ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ No comiste nada más ? What was to see ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: Ver. I saw :  \\nS: “Verí.” Yeah, sorry, vi.  \\nT: Vi. Good. You got the ending right. He saw :  \\nS: Vio.  \\nT: Vio. Good. You saw  (speaking informally):  \\nS: Viste .  \\nT: Viste . We saw :  \\nS: Vimos .  \\nT: Vimos . And they saw :  \\nS: Vieron .  \\nT: Vieron .  \\nS: The accent’s on the /e/.  \\nT: Yes, vieron.  So that’s our set. Vi, vio, vimos, viste, vieron . Good. Didn’t you see me last night?   \\n(speaking informally) Didn’t you se e me last night? :  \\nS: ¿No me viste anoche ?T: Good. ¿ No me viste anoche ? Time  in the sense of occasion, no? - like when we say once  we mean \\none time . Or when we say again  we mean another time - is vez. Vez. V-e-z. So in Spain this would \\nsound like / bes/. Vez.  \\nS: Vez.  \\nT: This is a feminine word, so how would you say one time or once ?  \\nS: Una vez .  \\nT: Una vez . So how would you say I saw him once ?  \\nS: Lo vi una vez .  \\nT: Good. Lo vi una vez . Good. How would you say I saw them once ?  \\nS: Los vi una v ez.  \\nT: Good. Los vi una vez . They saw them once :  \\nS: Los vieron una vez.  \\nT: Good. Los vieron una vez . How do you think you would say one more time , one more time , how \\ndo you think you would say that?  \\nS: Una vez más.  \\nT: Yes, una vez más . Good. So you co uld say something like I want to see them one more time. I \\nwant to see them one more time.  How would you say that?  \\nS: Quiero verlos una vez más.  \\nT: Good. Quiero verlos una vez más . I want to see them one more time. Once more.  What was the \\nword for we? The word for we:  \\nS: Nosotros .  \\nT: Nosotros . Good. Now nosotros  is actually the combination of nos, like how we have in us, and \\notros  which means others.  So we is kind of like us others . How would you say another time ? And \\nyou don’t say an other time in Span ish, you just say other time . So you don’t need an. So another \\ntime:S: Otra vez.  \\nT: Otra vez . Good. We can take this otros , we can work backwards to get otra,  otra vez . So you can \\nuse this like again.  Otra vez . Another time . So you could say I want to s ee them again. I want to \\nsee them again :  \\nS: Quiero verlos otra vez.  \\nT: Good. Quiero verlos otra vez . What was to leave or to go out ?  \\nS: Salir .  \\nT: Salir . Good. And what was to dance , related to ballerina?   \\nS: Bailar .  \\nT: Bailar . So how would you ask i nformally, did you go out to dance again?  Did you go out to dance \\nagain  (speaking informally) ?  \\nS: ¿Saliste a bailar otra vez?  \\nT: Very good. Saliste a , because we have this verb of motion of coming and going. ¿ Saliste a bailar \\notra vez ? Good. What was to speak ?  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar . And I spoke :  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Hablé . He spoke, she spoke, it spoke, you  (formal) spoke :  \\nS: Habló   \\nT: Habló . We spoke :  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . You (informal):  \\nS: Hablaste .  \\nT: Hablaste . And they:S: Hablaron .  \\nT: Hablar on. Well done. To arrive, to arrive  was llegar .  \\nS: Llegar .  \\nT: Llegar . How would you say you arrived , informally?  \\nS: Llegaste .  \\nT: Llegaste.  Did you arrive late again? Did you arrive late again? :  \\nS: So ¿ Llegaste tarde otra vez ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Llegaste tarde  otra vez ? Did you arrive late again?  Good. What was my house ?  \\nS: Mi casa.  \\nT: Mi casa . How would you say he arrived late to my house again ? So he arrived late to my house \\nagain :  \\nS: Llegó tarde a mi casa otra vez .  \\nT: Good. Llegó tarde a mi casa otra  vez. Or llegó a mi casa tarde otra vez . This is ah, flexible. \\nHow would you say he arrived at my house again, wanting to speak with me. He arrived at my \\nhouse, to my house, again, wanting to speak with me :  \\nS: Llegó a mi casa otra vez,  \\nT: Very good. Want ing:  \\nS: Is it querer,  to want ?  \\nT: Yes.  \\nS: So, queriendo.  Queriendo hablar conmigo.  \\nT: Good. Llegó a mi casa otra vez queriendo hablar conmigo . So we saw that we don’t use the -ing \\nin Spanish nearly half as much as we do in English. In English we really  overuse the -ing, but this \\nis one situation where we do want it, in structures like this. He arrived at my house again, wantingto speak with me . Llegó a mi casa otra vez queriendo hablar conmigo . Good. So my house is \\nmi casa , your house , speaking informa lly, is tu casa . Tu casa.  \\nS: Tu casa.  \\nT: You might have heard the expression mi casa es tu casa . What does that mean?  \\nS: My house is your house.   \\nT: If you want to say at what time , you say at what hour . How would that be?  \\nS: ¿A qué hora ?  \\nT: Hora . Her e we use hora.  ¿A qué hora ? Good. So how would you say at what time did they arrive \\nat your house? To your house? At what time did they arrive at your house? :  \\nS: ¿A qué hora llegaron a tu casa ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ A qué hora llegaron a tu casa ? Very good. At what time did they arrive at your house or \\nto your house?  Good. If you say a la vez , a la vez , it means at the same time , like in English when \\nwe say at a time . A la vez . Two at a time , we can say in English. This is at the time , at the same \\ntime. A la vez . So you might want to say everybody arrived at my house at the same time .  \\nWhat was the word for all?  \\nS: Todo .  \\nT: Todo . Good. If you make this plural, todos,  you get everybody.  Everybody,  or you might also hear \\nin Spanish todo el mundo . “All the world” to say everybody,  but todos  is very common. So \\neverybody arrived at my house at the same time :  \\nS: Todos llegaron a mi casa a la vez .  \\nT: Good. Todos llegaron a mi casa a la vez . Todos llegaron a la vez a mi casa . Flexible. What was \\nto find or to encounter ?  \\nS: Encontrar .  \\nT: Encontrar . And I found :  \\nS: Encontré .T: Encontré . I didn’t find anything else in your house . What was your house  again?  \\nS: Tu casa.  \\nT: Tu casa . Good. I didn’t find anything else, nothing more, in your house.  I didn’t find anything e lse \\nin your house :  \\nS: No encontré nada más en tu casa.  \\nT: Good. I didn’t find anything else in your house.  No encontré nada más en tu casa . Good. So we \\nhave mi casa, tu casa . Now the word for our is nuestro.  Our house is nuestra casa . Nuestra \\ncasa. We ca n see the o splitting of  nosotros  there in nuestro,  nuestra.  So that’s our. So how \\nwould you say did you visit our house?  What is to visit ? Visitation :  \\nS: Visitación . Visitar.  \\nT: Good. So did you visit our house , speaking informally:  \\nS: ¿Visitaste nuestra casa ?  \\nT: Good. ¿Visitaste nuestra casa ? Did you visit our house?  How would you say we are with our \\nfriends  - how do you think you would say that, we are with our friends ? We are with , what to be \\ndo you think we will use?  \\nS: Estar .  \\nT: Estar  because we are with , location. Good. So we are with our friends :  \\nS: Estamos con nuestros amigos.  \\nT: Good. Nuestros amigos . Good , you make it plural to match amigos.  We are with our friends.   \\nWhat if we meant all female friends?  \\nS: Estamos con nue stras amigas .  \\nT: Good. Estamos con nuestras amigas . How would you say I am with my friends ? I am with my \\nfriends :  \\nS: Estoy con , is it mis amigos ?T: Yes. Estoy con mis amigos . So the words for possession, mi, tu, nuestro  can change for number \\nto match  the number: mi amigo , mis amigos . And if it ends in -o like nuestro,  it can change for \\ngender as well. Nuestro amigo, nuestra amiga . So we have mi/my, tu/your,  nuestro  or \\nnuestra /our. For his/her/their/your  (speaking formally), for all of that, we have th e same word \\nwhich is su. Su. S-u.  \\nS: Su.  \\nT: Su. So how would you say I want to go to his house ? I want to go to his house :  \\nS: Quiero ir a su casa .  \\nT: Good. Quiero ir a su casa . I want to go to his house.  How would you say I want to go to their \\nhouse ?  \\nS: Quiero ir a su casa .  \\nT: Good. Quiero ir a su casa . So it’s the same. If you put it in plural or not refers to the things that \\nare possessed, not the possessors. So avoid any temptation to say sus, because you mean they.  You \\nare only going to say sus if you are saying houses,  for example. So if you were to say I want to go \\nto their houses , there you can put it in plural. How would that be?  \\nS: Quiero ir a sus casas.   \\nT: Good. Quiero ir a sus casas . And I want to go to his houses, I want to go to his  houses :  \\nS: Quiero ir a sus casas .  \\nT: Exactly. The same. Quiero ir a sus casas . So these possessive words mi, tu, nuestro , su, they \\nrefer to the thing being possessed, rather than the possessor when they’re changing. If you want to \\nsay my own house , if you want to say my own house or my very own house , you can say mi propia \\ncasa. Like property . Mi propia casa.  \\nS: Mi propia casa .  \\nT: Good. How would you say my own car ?  \\nS: Mi propio auto .T: Good. Mi propio auto . The word for eye in Spanish - not I as in your, eye as in the two things in \\nyour head, is ojo. Ojo. O-j-o. Ojo.  \\nS: Ojo.  \\nT: Ojo. How would you say my own eyes, my own eyes ?  \\nS: Mi propios ojos .  \\nT: There ’s some kind of disagreements going on in there.  \\nS: Mis. Mis propios ojos .  \\nT: Good.  So, I saw it with my own eyes. I saw it with my own eyes :  \\nS: Lo vi con mis propios ojos .  \\nT: Good. Lo vi con mis propios ojos . Very good. How would you say I want to live in my own house ? \\nI want to live in my own house :  \\nS: Quiero vivir en mi propio ca sa, mi propia casa .  \\nT: Good. Quiero vivir en mi propia casa . Good. I want to live in my own house . Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 66  \\nT: So, we are looking a bit at possession now, and how we express that in Spanish. Now, in English \\nwe use possessive words: my, your, his, her, much more than we do in Spanish. So, it’s something \\nwe want to look out for. We already saw an example actually, for example, how we would say I \\nresponded him the mail , rather than I responded to his mail . Another example would be how we \\nrefer to body  parts in Spanish. So you don’t say in Spanish, for example, my leg hurts , you say it \\nhurts me the leg . Doler , doler,  is to hurt . How would you say, firstly, it hurts me , from doler?  It \\nhurts me :  \\nS: Me dolo .  \\nT: It hurts me :  \\nS: Lo me -  \\nT: I want you to divide the sentence up and to take control of it, no guessing. It hurts me :  \\nS: Dole .  \\nT: Good, it would be “ dole”, but the o splits. So, this is an error that’s not a problem, you thought it \\nthrough and you got to “ dole”, but the o splits here.  \\nS: So, me duele .  \\nT: Me duele . Good. Me duele . So, you don’t say in Spanish my leg hurts – “mi pierna duele ” – you \\ndon’t say that, you say it hurts me the leg,  it hurts me the leg . So, leg is pierna,  how would you \\nsay my leg hurts ?  \\nS: Me duele la pierna .  \\nT: Goo d. Me duele la pierna . If you want to say my leg doesn’t hurt anymore , you can just use more  \\nfor anymore.  So, what was more,  again?  \\nS: Más.  \\nT: Más. So, my leg doesn’t hurt anymore :  \\nS: No me duele la pierna más .T: Good. Now, the noun, pain,  is dolor , dolor.   \\nS: Dolor .  \\nT: If you want to say I have a headache , you can just say I have pain of head – dolor de cabeza , \\ndolor de cabeza . So, how would that be, I have a headache ?  \\nS: Tengo dolor de cabeza .  \\nT: Good. Tengo dolor de cabeza . Good. I had, I was h aving, pain of head , so, the line in the past.  \\nS: Tenía dolor de cabeza .  \\nT: Good. Tenía dolor de cabeza . And of course we can also say me duele la cabeza or me dolía la \\ncabeza – this would be another way of saying it. So, just as we can say dolor de cabe za to say \\nheadache , the ache of the head . If we want to say José’s house , Maria’s house , in Spanish we will \\nsay the house of Maria , the house of José . So, how would you say the house of José, José’s house ?  \\nS: La casa de José .  \\nT: So, how would you say we are going to José’s house ?  \\nS: Vamos a la casa de José .  \\nT: Good. Vamos a la casa de José . What if you wanted to say we are going to Maria’s party,  we are \\ngoing to Maria’s party :  \\nS: Vamos a la fie -  \\nT: That’s correct.  \\nS: Vamos a la fiesta de Mar ía.  \\nT: Yes. Vamos a la fiesta de Mar ía. Very good. What was nobody ?  \\nS: Nadie .  \\nT: Nadie . And nobody else or nobody more :  \\nS: Nadie más.T: Good. I didn’t speak with anybody else in Maria’s party. I didn’t speak with anyone else in Maria’s \\nparty, I only spoke with you.  So, let’s start from the beginning. I didn’t speak :  \\nS: No hablé.  \\nT: With anybody else :  \\nS: Con nadie más.  \\nT: In Maria’s party :  \\nS: En la fiesta de Mar ía.  \\nT: Good. No hablé con nadie más en la fiesta de Mar ía, I only spo ke with you . Now, only or just, \\nthat we say a lot in English, I just spoke with you , I only spoke with you , in Spanish is solo, solo.   \\nSo, I only spoke with you  (speaking informally):  \\nS: Hablaste ,  \\nT: I only spoke , with you , don’t let it blend together.  \\nS: Hablé contigo solo.  \\nT: Good. Or, more naturally might be solo hablé contigo . But solo at the end there, it’s fine, it just  \\nsounds more emphatic, you might want to be emphatic here: no hablé con nadie más en la fiesta \\nde Maria, solo hablé contigo . Hablé solo contigo, hablé contigo solo .',\n",
       " \"Track 67  \\nT: I would like to talk a little bit more about writing in Spanish. So, we haven’t really looked so much \\nabout how to read and write in Spanish, we’ve spelled some words, we’ve discussed some sounds \\nand we ’ve looked at convertible words , convertible  words that we convert over from Latin English \\ninto Spanish, and they give us a great idea about how to read and write in Spanish.  \\nFor example, if we have a / j/ sound, for example in general,  how is this pronou nced in Spanish?  \\nS: /kheneral /.  \\nT: /kheneral /. And it’s spelled the same. So, there we understand that g-e makes / khe/ sound without \\nhaving to learn it formally, we can just look back to these convertible words when we are unsure \\nof how a sound might be pronounced. So, maybe you see c-e together and you are like “is that / se/ \\nor is that / ke/?” But then if you look back to concentración , then you have your answer: “con-\\ncen”: c-e, concentración  gives you your answer. So, apart from the actual sounds we also  need to \\nunderstand where the stress in any given word is when we read it. So, in Spanish, you may have \\nnoticed you have written accents, little dashes above some vowels. Now, this isn’t like French, for \\nexample, where the little dashes might actually change the sound of the vowel . None of that, \\nluckily, is going on in Spanish. The written accent is just showing the stress, but why do we have \\nit sometimes and not other times? So, there is a general rule in Spanish, which is: if the word ends \\nin a vowel, an n, or an s, the accent should be on the penultimate syllable, on the second last \\nsyllable. Now, why do you think vowels and then n’s and s’s have been singled out for that role, \\nwhat if you look at our verbs? What do our verb forms end in?  \\nS: W ell the “they” end in an n.  \\nT: Right.  \\nS: Ah yes, s as well.  \\nT: Or?  \\nS: Vowel.  \\nT: Exactly. So, it’s what our verbs end in: an n, s, or vowel. So, Spanish says if a word ends in n, s, \\nor a vowel, then natural accent will be on the penultimate syllable , the second last syllable.Diferente , habla , hablan , hablas , hablamos , ending s, but we are adding two syllables, so still \\non the second last, hablamos . Importante , adictivo . Now, if the word ends in any other \\nconsonant, any other consonant that ’s not n or s, then the natural accent place is to go to the end \\nof the word, and we see this perfectly with any “to” verb. How do you say to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Accent on the end. Comer . To be , for states?  \\nS: Estar .  \\nT: Estar . To speak :  \\nS: Hablar .  \\nT: Hablar .  To find :  \\nS: Encontrar .  \\nT: Encontrar . So, this r is not an n or an s or a vowel, and what that means is that the accent is coming \\non the end. So, these are our natural accents, and if the word obeys the rules of the natural accents, \\nwe have no  written accent, generally, there's a couple of exceptions which I will mention. So, if \\nthere is no written accent, you follow those rules. If it ends n, s, or vowel, you put the accent on \\nthe second last syllable, and if it ends in any other consonant you  are putting the accent on the end. \\nBut if your word breaks th is rule, then you have a written accent to show you where you should \\nbe stressing. So, for example, what is tradition  in Spanish?  \\nS: Tradición .  \\nT: Tradición . And what are you ending it wit h? What is the last letter?  \\nS: n.  \\nT: And where is the accent?  \\nS: At the end.  \\nT: At the end. Does this break our rule?  \\nS: Yes.T: So, the /o/ will have a written accent, that last o will have a written accent on the end, showing you \\nthat you are stres sing it. Tradición . So, all of these –ión words, that all have their accent on the \\nend - situación , opinión  - they all have a written accent there on the end. So, now I’m gonna tell \\nyou some words, that we’ve come across already, and I want you to tell me if they will have a \\nwritten accent or not. So, what you need to decide is “are they breaking the accent rule or not”.  \\nEncuentro .  Encuentro . Firstly, what does that mean, encuentro ?  \\nS: I encounter.   \\nT: Good, I find . Encuentro . Do we have a written acce nt there?  \\nS: No.  \\nT: No, good. Encontró . What does that mean first, encontró ?  \\nS: I- sorry. He/she/it  or you (formal) found .  \\nT: Good. And does it have a written accent?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: Yes, because it’s breaking the rule, we're ending in a vowel and we ha ve the accent on the end. So, \\nall of these, in that point in the past, are gonna have the accent. Encontró, habló, llamó, llegó . \\nGood. Vive . Vive . Firstly , what does that mean? Vive : \\nS: He/she/it/you  (formal) live.  \\nT: Good. Does it have an accent?  \\nS: No.  \\nT: Good. Vivió :  \\nS: It has an accent.  \\nT: Where?  \\nS: At the o.T: Good. Vivió  – he lived, she lived, you  (formal) lived, it lived . Limón , what do you think limón  \\nmeans?  \\nS: Lemon .  \\nT: Lemon . Good. Which is a Persian word actually, and it actual ly was used to talk about citrus fruits \\ngenerically, generally, and lime came from the same word, so lemon  and lime is actually the same \\nword essentially. Does it have an accent, limón ?  \\nS: Yes.  \\nT: Yes, cause it should be LI-mon , right, but it’s not,  it’s li-MÓN , it’s breaking that rule, so it has a \\nwritten accent. So, when we are reading Spanish, if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, we \\nwant to put the accent on the penultimate syllable . If it ends in another consonant, we wanna put \\nthe accent on the end, unless we are shown with a written accent that the rule is being broken. \\nSalud  means health,  related to salute  in English. Salud,  and you can say it when you toast. Does \\nit have a written accent?  \\nS: No.  \\nT: No, good, it ends in a d, so we expect the accent to be on the end, salud . So, usually accents are \\nwritten to show us that we are breaking the accent rule, but there are some other situations where \\nwe have a written accent. One of these situations is when we have words that are m onosyllables – \\nwords that are just one syllable - and we can differentiate them with a written accent. For example, \\nhow was the word for yes?  \\nS: Sí.  \\nT: And how was the word for if?  \\nS: Si.  \\nT: Si. It’s the same word, so yes is written with a written accent, and if is not . Now th is written accent \\ndoesn’t change the pronunciation, this differentiates them so when you are reading you don’t have \\nthe ambiguity that could sometimes be caused by “oh, is that a yes or an if?”, both could make \\nsense the re, especially because you use yes emphatically, in Spanish you can say sí lo quiero , yes \\nI want it , but if that’s written and you don’t hear the emphasis, sí lo quiero , then you might readif I want it . So, to clear up that ambiguity when you have monosyl lables - words of one syllable -  \\nthat are the same, one will take an accent to show the difference. How was for me ?  \\nS: Para mí  or por mí .  \\nT: Good, very good, either one, depending what for you want. Now, how was my house ?  \\nS: Mi casa .  \\nT: Mi casa . So, this is different mi: one is the mí that comes after prepositions – para mí , por mí , de \\nmí – and the other one is for possession – my. So, para mí : there you have the written accent on \\nthe mí of para mí , and you don’t have it on mi casa , just to show the difference. What was the \\nword for you, speaking informally?  \\nS: Tú.  \\nT: Tú. And what was your house ?  \\nS: Tu casa.   \\nT: Tu casa . The word for you, tú, takes a written accent, but the word for your in your house , tu casa , \\ndoesn’t. So, monosyllables that  are the same are differentiated by accent. I know , how do you say \\nI know ?  \\nS: Sé.  \\nT: Yes, this sé has a written accent; the se of se lo doy , I give it to him , the se of se queda , he remains \\nhimself/she remains herself , doesn’t have an accent; only the sé of saber , I know , has one. So, it’s \\nsomething you will pick up reading. Another example where we have accents is to differentiate \\nquestion words from non -question words when they are the same. For example you have donde , \\nwhat does donde  mean?  \\nS: Where .  \\nT: Where . But sometimes donde  is a question word, like ¿dónde estás ? Where are you ? There it will \\ngo with an accent, but if I say I’m going to meet him where we saw the football , this is not a \\nquestion, so it doesn’t have an accent, so Span ish likes to differentiate them as well. But now we \\nare entering quite a bit of detail and many Spanish speakers, when they are writing, make thesemistakes as well and don’t put these accents where they should, but I’m explaining just in case you \\ncome acr oss dónde  with an accent and you don’t understand why it’s there because it’s not \\nbreaking the accent rule – this is why. So, in the same way we have como , which means how or \\nlike, the cómo  for how takes an accent and the como  for like doesn’t. So, there a re a couple of \\ngrammatical examples, when we are having accents just to differentiate words that are the same or \\nto differentiate question words from non -question words, but most of the time they are directing \\nus to break the accenting rules. And it’s very  easy to remember the accenting rules because we \\nonly need to look at the present tense. We know that our verbs end in vowels, n’s or s’s, and in the \\npresent tense we always have the accent on the penultimate syllable without any written accent, \\nwith, of c ourse, that one exception, estar , where we have estás , están , está and we do have a \\nwritten accent. So we can look back there at the present tense to remind us that if the word ends n, \\ns, or vowel, the natural accent is on the penultimate syllable, like t he verbs in the present tense, \\nand if it ends in any other letter, the  natural accent is on the end of the word. And if we break this \\nrule we show it with a written accent.\",\n",
       " \"Track 68  \\nT: What was tonight  in Spanish, tonight ?  \\nS: Esta noche.  \\nT: Esta no che. Good, “this night”. And we can use this as a hook to work out the other this’s and \\nthat’s and these  and those  that we might need. So, esta noche , which tells us that noche  is what \\nkind of noun, what gender?  \\nS: Feminine.  \\nT: Feminine. Good, and what i f you wanted to say that night ? What do you do to esta to get that?  \\nS: Esa.  \\nT: Esa. Good, take away the t, good, so that night :  \\nS: Esa noche.   \\nT: Esa noche . And those nights :  \\nS: Esas noches .  \\nT: Esas noches . Good. The word for man is hombre , hombre , h-o-m-b-r-e, hombre .  \\nS: Hombre .  \\nT: Good. How would you say this man ?  \\nS: Esta hombre .  \\nT: You think hombre  is a feminine word?  \\nS: No. Este hombre.  \\nT: Este hombre . Good. That man:   \\nS: Ese hombre.  \\nT: Good. You can also say el hombre este , el hombre ese , to say this man or that man in Spanish, \\nwhich might be a structure taken from Arabic, because in Arabic you don’t really have to be in thepresent tense, so you can’t say this man , because you would understand from it that this is a man , \\nso in Arabic it’s  the same : alrajul hdha  - el hombre este . As I mentioned before when languages \\ncome into contact, like the eight hundred years between Spanish and Arabic, they don’t just share \\nvocabulary. How would you say these men ?  \\nS: Estos hombres.   \\nT: Good. Estos hombres . So, with este we have the /e/ of el, el hombre , este hombre , and with estos  \\nwe have the -os of los, los hombres , estos hombres , these men . How about those men ?  \\nS: Esos hombres.  \\nT: Esos hombres . Good. So, this means that we hav e este and esta for this, when we are referring to \\na masculine noun or a feminine noun. But sometimes we say this just generally, oh, I can’t believe \\nthis, we don’t mean a specific noun when we say I can’t believe this , so we have like a neuter this, \\nthat is not masculine or feminine, and that one is esto. So, creer  is to believe , creer , with two e’s. \\nHow would you say I don’t believe this ?  \\nS: No creo esto.  \\nT: Good. No creo esto . Good. I don't believe this . How would you say I don’t like anything more t han \\nthis? In Spanish we will say nothing pleases me more than this , nothing pleases me more than this , \\nI don’t like anything more than this :  \\nS: Nada me gusta más que esto.   \\nT: Good. Nada me gusta más que esto . How would you say nothing pleased me mor e than that ? I \\ndidn’t like anything more than that, nothing pleased me more than that :  \\nS: Nada me gusta -  \\nT: Nothing pleased me :  \\nS: Nada me gustó más que eso.  \\nT: Good. Nada me gustó más que eso . Nothing pleased me more than that, I didn’t like anythin g \\nmore than that. Nada me gustó más que eso . Tan, tan, in Spanish means so, like in the sense of \\nso tired , tan. T-a-n. How would you say so tired ?S: Tan cansado.  \\nT: Good. So, how would you say I was so tired , and we mean a line in time ?  \\nS: Estaba tan cansado.  \\nT: And you being feminine?  \\nS: Cansada .  \\nT: Good. Estaba tan cansada . What if you wanted to say we were so tired that we slept all day ? So, \\nfirst bit is we were so tired , let’s be a masculine or mixed group, we were so tired :  \\nS: Estábamo s tan cansado - cansados.  \\nT: Good. Estábamos tan cansados , that we slept all day.  So what is this that?  \\nS: Que.  \\nT: Que. Estábamos tan cansados que  we slept all day.  Now, all day  is “all the day”, you remember \\nhow is day?  \\nS: Día.  \\nT: Día. And the day :  \\nS: La día.  \\nT: It would be, but -  \\nS: El día.  \\nT: El día . It ends in a, but it’s masculine. So, all day  is “all the day”, how would it be?  \\nS: Toda -  \\nT:  It’s masculine.  \\nS: Todo el día.  \\nT: We were so tired that we slept all day, we were so tired that we sl ept all day :  \\nS: Estábamos tan cansados que dormimos todo el día.T: Very good. Estábamos tan cansados que dormimos todo el día . So dormimos  could be we slept \\nor we sleep , we know it’s the same in the present, but estábamos  tan cansados  gives us our \\nconte xt, so we understand that of course it refers to past, estábamos tan cansados que dormimos \\ntodo el día . How would you say we were so tired when we arrived that we slept all day ? So, we \\nwere so tired :  \\nS: Estábamos tan cansados.  \\nT: When we arrived :  \\nS: Cuando llegamos.  \\nT: That we slept all day :  \\nS: Que dormimos todo el día.  \\nT: Good. Estábamos tan cansados cuando llegamos que dormimos todo el día . So, here in this \\nsentence we have llegamos  and dormimos  that could be past or present, but estábamos  bring s us \\ninto the context right from the beginning, estábamos tan cansados cuando llegamos que \\ndormimos todo el día . So, we said that when  was:  \\nS: Cuándo .  \\nT: Cuándo . And how much is cuánto , with a t, cuánto .  \\nS: Cuánto .  \\nT: Cuánto . How do you say again , like  another time ?  \\nS: Otra vez.  \\nT: Otra vez . Good. So, you could say how many times , how would that be? How many times :  \\nS: Cuántos veces - Cuántas veces?  \\nT: Cuántas veces . Good. We know it’s feminine, because we said otra vez , and not otro vez . So, we \\ncan, if we have a word like vez where it’s not obvious what is the gender, we need to look back to \\nsomewhere that we used it – otra vez , oh, ok, it’s feminine, cuántas veces , good. How would you \\nsay I don’t know how many times I visited him ? I don’t know how many times I visited him :S: No sé cuántas veces.  \\nT: I visited him :  \\nS: Lo visité.  \\nT: No sé cuántas veces lo visité . I don’t know how many times they visited him , I don’t know how \\nmany times they visited him :  \\nS: No sé cuántas veces los visitaron - oh, him- lo visitaron .  \\nT: Good. No sé cuántas veces lo visitaron . And what if you wanted to say I don’t know how many \\ntimes they visited her ?  \\nS: No sé cuántas veces la visitaron.  \\nT: Good. No sé cuántas veces la visitaron.\",\n",
       " 'Track 69  \\nT: So now we have a pan orama of times in Spanish. We’ve seen all of the different times. We can \\nfind will, would , the present, the pasts, the have  tenses. Maybe some of these we are clearer on \\nthan others, but we’ve learned how to find what we might think we don’t know and how t o analyze \\nthe language, so that through listening to Spanish we can reinforce the language that we’ve learned \\nand bring it to the surface and pick up again anything that we might have forgotten along the way. \\nBut there is one more tense to learn in Spanish . One more very important tense in Spanish, and \\npersonally it’s my favorite thing about Spanish. In Spanish we have what we can call a mood tense, \\nthe subjunctive tense in grammatical terminology, but we will call it the mood tense because it’s a \\ntense tha t just shows mood. Now, you might be interested to hear that we also have it in English. \\nNow, we don’t use it as much in English as we do in Spanish but it is there. For example, in English \\nyou can say it is important that you are here  or it is important t hat you be here . So, it’s important \\nthat you are here  sounds more everyday, let’s say, more casual. It’s important that you be here ; \\nthat gives us a different feeling. It feels more serious, it feels more imperative. How are we \\nachieving that feeling? We ’re using be instead of you are . We are using you be . It’s important that \\nyou be here . Another example of how English uses this mood, I might say had I gone, I would \\nknow. Had I gone, I would know . Now, had I , that inversion of I had to had I usually is to  make a \\nquestion. Had you gone already? for example. But here it’s not a question. Had I gone, I would \\nknow . Here we are creating a mood tense. We are saying if I had gone with had I gone . We also \\nsay not only is it , for example, not only is it a problem, it’s the biggest problem . Not only is it , \\nagain, is it is what we do to make a question. But here it’s not a question. Not only is it a problem, \\nit’s the biggest problem . So the changing of the order of is and it gives us this mood tense here in \\nEnglish as  well. So we don’t need to analyze too much how it works in English, because there’s \\nnot so much correlation between English and Spanish about how it works. It’s used much more \\nextensively in Spanish. But the idea is not completely alien to us. In Spanish,  it’s a very common \\nthing that will allow you and oblige you to perceive and to express the world in a certain way. \\nNow, to form the mood tense, to form the subjunctive tense in Spanish, is very easy, and we don’t \\nneed to learn any new sounds to do it. All  we do is we switch between the verbs. With –ar verbs \\nwe will use the –er/-ir endings, and with –er/-ir verbs we will use the –ar verb endings. And that’s \\nhow we build this tense. So, for example, how is to speak ?S: Hablar .  \\nT: And how is he speaks ?  \\nS: Hablá .  \\nT: Habla .  \\nS: Sorry, habla. Habla.  \\nT: Habla . Good. The accent there at the beginning. Habla . Now if you want to make this the mood \\ntense, we will switch groups. We we will switch groups. Verbs from the –ar group use –er/-ir \\nendings, and verbs from the -er/-ir group use –ar endings. So how would you make habla  in the \\nmood tense?  \\nS: Hable .  \\nT: Hable . Good. So you have they speak :  \\nS: Hablan .  \\nT: Hablan . And the mood tense version will be?  \\nS: Hablen .  \\nT: Hablen . Good. How is I speak ?  \\nS: Hablo .  \\nT: Hablo . Of course if we go from hablo  in the –ar group and we go to -er/-ir we will still have \\nhablo . We will change an o for an o. So we don’t do that. Hablo  will also become hable . So again \\nwe have a situation where I jumps in with he, she, it , and you (formal). So hable  can also be the \\nmood tense for I. What is we speak ?  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . And the mood tense of we speak :  \\nS: Hablemos .T: Hablemos . Good. We are using the /e/, not that odd i that pops up with the –ir verbs in the present \\nlike vivimos , salimos . -emos  for the mood tense. Hablemos . What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . I eat:  \\nS: Como .  \\nT: Como . But the mood tense version would be?  \\nS: Coma .  \\nT: Good. Coma . And what else can coma  mean, then?  \\nS: He/she/it  version of the moo d tense.  \\nT: Good, and you (formal). Very good. They eat , normal tense, present tense?  \\nS: Comen .  \\nT: Comen . And the mood tense?  \\nS: Coman .  \\nT: Coman . Good. So it’s going to be great to practice this mood tense, because of course you have to \\nfirst think wh at the verb should be, and then you switch it. So we’re going to have a nice practice \\nmentally, in our mental exercises, of the tenses that we already learned whilst we are building the \\nmood tense. So the use of the mood tense we can divide between obligat ory and optional. There \\nare some situations in which we absolutely must use the mood tense, otherwise it will be \\nconsidered an error. It will sound incorrect and distract from what we are saying. And then there \\nare cases where the use of the mood tense is optional. You can use it to give a different meaning \\nor a different flavor or a different feeling, which is the much more exciting area, where it’s \\noptional. But the obligatory uses will allow us a very important exposure to the feeling of the mood \\ntense. So now we’re going to look at some examples. In English when you say I want you to wait, \\nI want you to wait , this is quite a peculiar structure in English. And it’s not really translated in this \\nway in many other languages. I want you to wait . In most othe r Romance languages, at least, it’s \\ntranslated as I want that you wait . This is how we would say it in French or Portuguese or Italian.So I want you to wait is I want that you wait . Now, this you wait is going to be in the mood tense. \\nWhen we are expressi ng what we want in this way, we will use the mood tense. We are putting \\nour subjectivity onto the world when we say I want that and following this that, we will use the \\nmood tense. So how would you say I want you to wait ? I want that you wait  (informally ):  \\nS: So I want remains the same and it’s quiero . That is que. And then you wait becomes espere .  \\nSorry, esperes .  \\nT: Good. All together, I want that you wait :  \\nS: Quiero que esperes.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que esperes . Ah? So if you say quiero que esperas , here it would be considered \\nan error. This is an obligatory use of the subjunctive, of the mood tense. Quiero que esperes . I \\nwant you to wait for him , or I want you to wait for it :  \\nS: Quiero que lo esperes.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que lo esperes . I want you to w ait for it or for him.  Very good. Do you want me to \\nwait?  So first let’s find the in -between sentence. Give it to me in English, how we will say it in \\nSpanish. Do you want me to wait? :  \\nS: Do you want that I wait for you ?  \\nT: You made it more complicated. It’s just do you want that I wait?  But, let’s put it. So do you want \\nme to wait for you?  Give me that one. Do you want me to wait for you?  And let’s speak informally.  \\nS: ¿Quieres que te espere?   \\nT: Very good. ¿ Quieres que te espere ? And of course this cou ld mean : Do you want me to wait for \\nyou? Do you want him to wait for you ? Do you want her to wait for you ? So if we wanted to clarify \\nI, how would we do that? Do you want me to wait for you? :  \\nS: ¿Quieres que yo te espere ?  \\nT: Very good. ¿ Quie res que yo te espere ?',\n",
       " \"Track 70  \\nT: What was the word for what ?  \\nS: Qué.  \\nT: Qué. What , when it’s not a question, is lo que , lo que .  \\nS: Lo que.  \\nT: For example, if you want to say I saw what you’re doing , this is not a question, no? I saw what \\nyou’re doin g. Here, the what  is not a question. Here it’s lo que . I cooked what they’re eating . I \\ncooked what they’re eating . Here, what  is not a question, no? Yo cociné , I cooked , lo que comen , \\nor lo que están comiendo if we mean right now. So, what  not as a q uestion is  lo que . How would \\nyou say I don’t want you to speak about what we spoke about  - but you know we don’t need this \\nabout . So the first bit is I don’t want you to speak , and let’s speak informally. I don’t want you to \\nspeak, I don’t want that you sp eak:  \\nS: No quiero que hables .  \\nT: Very good. No quiero que hables . About :  \\nS: Is it de?  \\nT: De, you could use, or you could use?  \\nS: Sobre .  \\nT: Sobre . Good. So, no quiero que hables de , or sobre  what we spoke about , and we can just say \\nwhat we spoke :  \\nS: Lo que hablamos.   \\nT: Yes. It’s the same in the past. So give it to me now all together. I don’t want you to speak about \\nwhat we spoke about.  From the beginning and thinking it through again.  \\nS: No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos.  \\nT: Good. No quie ro que hables sobre lo que hablamos , or no quiero que hables de lo que \\nhablamos . Good. But that sentence could be ambiguous, no? I mean, in your mind, when you’recreating this sentence you will have the context very strongly in your mind that you’re think ing \\nabout what we spoke about the other day. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the person \\nreceiving it has that same context in their mind. They might, depends what your conversation is \\nabout. But if you don’t have a context that’s shared, it could be  ambiguous. You could understand \\nI don’t want you to speak about what we speak about  generally . Because of course we have \\nhablamos , which can be past or present. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos . \\nGenerally. So there’s two ways here that you could  clarify. You could add something like the other \\nday, el otro día . No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablamos el otro día . So you are showing \\nwith some time expression that it was past. Or you could use the line in the past. What we were \\nspeaking about . Because here it’s interchangeable, the meaning changes so slightly and both \\nmeanings are fine, no? If we look at English, I don’t want you to speak about what we were \\nspeaking about . I don’t want you to speak about what we spoke about . So maybe here in Spani sh \\nyou choose the line in the past just so it’s obvious that you’re talking about the past. So let’s give \\nit another go, using the line in the past. I don’t want you to speak about what we were speaking \\nabout. I don’t want you to speak  (informally still):  \\nS: No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablábamos .  \\nT: Very good. No quiero que hables sobre lo que hablábamos . Necessity  in Spanish is – do you \\nremember what to do with -ity words to make them Spanish?  \\nS: -idad.  \\nT: Good. So necessity  becomes:  \\nS: Necesid ad.  \\nT: Necesidad . To need  is necesitar .  \\nS: Necesitar .  \\nT: Good. How would you say I need ?  \\nS: Necesito .  \\nT: Necesito . I need you to prepare it.  Let’s speak formally. I need you to prepare it  (formally):  \\nS: In English again it would be I need that you prepare it .T: Exactly.  \\nS: Necesito que lo prepare .  \\nT: Very good. Necesito que lo prepare . This is to you, formally. If you wanted to make it clear that \\nyou are speaking to you and not speaking about him or her, how would you do that here? I need \\nyou to  prepare it :  \\nS: Necesito que usted lo prepare .  \\nT: Very good. Necesito que usted lo prepare . Necesito que lo prepare usted . Very good. So with \\nquiero que , necesito que , we’re seeing two things that they have in common. We have a verb like \\nquiero , necesi to, a verb that’s showing what we want to occur in the world, expressing our \\nsubjectivity, let’s say, in this way, and we have the structural similarity that the mood tense is \\ncoming after que. To be short of, to be short of, to be missing, to lack , is faltar. Quite \\nuncomfortable translations, but this is a very common verb in Spanish. Faltar . It’s used very often, \\nthis verb in Spanish. For example, you could say I need you to prepare what’s missing . I need you \\nto prepare what’s missing . What’s left over, what we need to do still , ah? So again, formally, I \\nneed you to prepare :  \\nS: Necesito que prepare.  \\nT: Good. What’s missing .  \\nS: Lo que falta.  \\nT: Necesito que prepare lo que falta . And lo que because the what  here is not a question. Very good. \\nThe noun is  also used quite often. The noun is falta , la falta . So falta means lack, lack. So if I say \\nfalta de consideración , what does it mean? Falta de consideración :  \\nS: Oh, right. Lack of consideration .  \\nT: Good. Lack of consideration.  It’s also used with respec t, falta de respeto , lack of respect . And it’s \\nalso used in the expression hace falta . “It makes lack .” “It makes lack .” Which is just another way \\nof saying it’s necessary , but it’s very common. And hace falta que of course is followed by this \\nmood tense  in the same way that we do with quiero que , necesito que , we will follow it with thismood tense. So, if you wanted to say, using hace falta , it is necessary that we eat soon , what was \\nthe word for soon ?  \\nS: Is it pronto , or is that Italian?  \\nT: That ’s it. In Italian, actually, it means ready , pronto . This is why when Italians answer the phone, \\nthey say pronto , because historically, let’s say, there was an operator there connecting the wires. \\nAnd they were there going ready? Are you ready? Is it ready ? Can you hear me? But in Spanish \\nit’s soon . Like the British slang. People say in England get here pronto , get here soon . So it makes \\nlack, hace falta , it makes lack that we eat soon :  \\nS: Sorry, can you explain again how, why does that make sense? It makes lack that we eat soon ?  \\nT: It makes lack  would be the literal translation, but literal translations are often uncomfortable, no? \\nEspecially when we’re talking about fixed expressions. So hace falta is an extremely common \\nexpression, quite difficult to  translate comfortably. Just another way of saying it’s necessary . So \\nit makes lack or hace falta that we eat soon . How would it be?  \\nS: Hace falta que comamos pronto .  \\nT: Hace falta que comamos pronto . So hace falta you will hear around a lot, and falta  as a noun, \\nyou will hear it especially in phrases like falta de respeto , a lack of respect , you hear that a lot. \\nAnd faltar  as a verb, to lack , or to be missing is also very useful. To prefer in Spanish is preferir . \\nPreferir .  \\nS: Preferir .  \\nT: Preferir . How is I prefer ?  \\nS: Prefero .  \\nT: It should be.  \\nS: Prefiero .  \\nT: Better. Prefiero . Good. So again if you say I prefer him to stay , you’re not going to say I prefer \\nhim to stay , we will say I prefer that he stays , and what are we going to do with he st ays? I think \\nyou’re getting the gist now.S: Mood tense.  \\nT: Mood tense. So it’s not just the structures that we are identifying, it’s the feeling. This is very \\nimportant for the mood tense. What you want to really get your head around is the feeling  of the \\nmood tense, so you can start experimenting about where you would use it and listening out for \\nwhere you hear people using it. I prefer that he stays, I prefer for him to stay, I prefer that he stays :  \\nS: Prefiero que se queda . Sorry, quede .  \\nT: Goo d. Prefiero que se quede . I prefer them to stay, I prefer for them to stay :  \\nS: Prefiero que se queden.  \\nT: Prefiero que se queden . I prefer that they don’t stay here . I prefer that they don’t stay here . I \\nprefer for them not to stay here :  \\nS: Prefiero  que se – que no se queden aquí.   \\nT: Good. Prefiero que no se queden aquí . Very good. How would you say I prefer you to give it to \\nhim? I prefer you , speaking informally, to give it to him :  \\nS: So it's I prefer that you give it to him ?  \\nT: Exactly.  \\nS: Prefiero que lo le – ah, se lo des .  \\nT: That’s it. Good. Prefiero que se lo des . So this could mean I prefer you to give it to him, to her , \\nhow would we clarify it? If we want to show it’s to him. I prefer you to give it to him :  \\nS: Prefiero que se lo des a  él.  \\nT: Very good. And what if it was to her?  \\nS: A ella. Prefiero que se lo des a ella .  \\nT: Good. Prefiero que se lo des a ella. Very good. So to clarify we can then say  a él, a ella , to show \\nafterwards who we meant with  se.\",\n",
       " 'Track 71  \\nT: To count in Span ish is contar , contar .  \\nS: Contar .  \\nT: Contar . We can see that it’s the same word, but it’s also to recount , like in English how you say \\nto recount a story . So, contar , you can also use it like to tell , especially with telling stories. How \\nwould you say I tell?  \\nS: I’m tempted to say cuento .  \\nT: Cuento , you would be correct, cuento , good, the o splits. So, cuento  is I tell , and cuento is the \\nnoun, meaning story , un cuento is a story . So, we can see how contar  is to count , but also to \\nrecount or another ve rb for to tell . C-o-n-t-a-r. So, how would you say I want you to tell me, I want \\nyou to recount to me  (informally )?  \\nS: Quiero que me cuentes.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que me cuentes . I want you to tell me something  and speaking plurally now, \\nspeaking to more than one you:  \\nS: Quiero que me cuenten algo.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que me cuenten algo . To count on , to count on,  in the sense of you can count on \\nme, to count on is contar con , so, “to count with” in Spanish. So, how would you say I want you \\nto count on me ? I want you to count on me  (speaking informally):  \\nS: Quiero que cuentes con mi - conmigo.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que cuentes conmigo.  Good. I want you to count on me . Quiero que cuentes \\nconmigo . Very good. So, we said that sometimes, between English and Spanish,  that the \\nprepositions might change, we say to count on in English and in Spanish to count with . We also \\nspoke about how we can use the negative language transfer of Spanish speakers speaking English, \\nthat may make some mistake and we can make certain assu mptions about Spanish through that. \\nSo, maybe we hear a native Spanish speaker speaking English, saying you can count with me , and \\nif we hear that a couple of times we can understand that that’s probably how it’s said in Spanish.So, we can take advantage of any negative language transfer we may hear from Spanish speakers \\nin English. What was to wait or to hope ?  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: Esperar . So, if you say I hope that , then of course you will also follow this up with our mood \\ntense. So, how would you say I hope that you count on me  (informally )?  \\nS: Espero que cuentes conmigo.  \\nT: Good. Espero que cuentes conmigo . I hope that you count on me.  Good. How would you say We \\nhope that they count on Maria ? We hope that they count on Maria :  \\nS: Esperamos que c uenten con Mar ía.  \\nT: Good. Esperamos que cuenten con Mar ía. We hope that they count on Maria. What if you wanted \\nto say we hope that they tell Maria it , using contar ? So now we’re using contar , to count , like to \\nrecount , we hope that they r ecount it to Maria , we hope that they tell it to Maria :  \\nS: Esperamos que lo cuenten a Mar ía.  \\nT: Very good. Esperamos que lo cuenten a Mar ía. So, here we have the other meaning of contar , \\nto recount, to tell . What was to see ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: Ver. So, if we say, for example, we hope that they see Maria , what is they see  in the present?  \\nS: Ven.  \\nT: Ven. Now, if you want to make the mood tense and you switch to the other side you would get \\n“van”, which would probably cause, especially in the optiona l uses of the mood tense, a lot of \\nconfusion, because “van” sounds like -  \\nS: Like they are going .  \\nT: Yes, so, we actually build the mood tense on the I form, which was the only irregular form of ver \\nin the present. Do you remember how to say I see ?  \\nS: Veo.T: Veo. So, we kept the e. So, the mood tense is based on this version to avoid any ambiguity that \\nmight be caused with va, vas, van. So, how would you say I hope that they see,  I hope that they \\nsee:  \\nS: Espero que vean.  \\nT: Good. Espero que vean . Now,  if you want to say I hope that they see Maria , we will say a María . \\nNow the literal translation doesn’t make any sense: I hope that they see to Maria . In Spanish we \\nhave this personal a, that we use when we are referring to somebody that we are doing  the action \\nof the verb to. So, in this case the person that we are doing the action of seeing  to, espero que \\nvean a María . The reason for this is that the order in Spanish is quite flexible, words like María  \\ncan come before the verb or after th e verb, which might cause confusion about whether Maria is \\ndoing or being done to, whether David  is doing or being done to. So, when it’s being done to, we \\ninclude this a, and when there is not any other preposition there that shows us that we are doing it  \\nto, so we saw already, for example, contar con María , there we don’t need the a, but if there is \\nno other preposition we will have to put that a. So, let’s practice this. What is to understand ?  \\nS: Comprender .  \\nT: Comprender . So, how would you say,  I hope that you , speaking informally, I hope that you \\nunderstand David ? David. I hope that you understand David:   \\nS: Espero que comprendas a David .  \\nT: Good. Espero que comprendas a David . How would you say the same sentence speaking \\nformally? I hope t hat you , formally, I hope that you understand David :  \\nS: Espero que comprenda a David.  \\nT: Good. Espero que comprenda a David . Now, we can see why this a is important, because if it \\nweren’t there, if we were to say espero que comprenda David , it would soun d like I hope that \\nDavid understands , because David is flexible: espero que David comprenda , espero que \\ncomprenda David  would both mean I hope that David understands . So, to make it clear, this habit \\nformed in Spanish of putting the a there. For example, t he word for man was? Begins with a silent \\nh.  \\nS: Hombre .T: Hombre . The man :  \\nS: El hombre.  \\nT: El hombre . If you say to the man , “a el hombre ”, a and el, they stick together and they form al, \\nand it’s written like this : a-l, al hombre . So, if you were to  say I want him to see the man, I want \\nthat he sees the man, I want that he sees to the man , so how would that be?  \\nS: Quiero que va -  \\nT: We go from veo, to avoid that ambiguity.  \\nS: Vea. Quiero que vea al hombre.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que vea al hombre . But if  you were to say: I want the man to see, I want that the \\nman sees :  \\nS: Quiero que el hombre vea.  \\nT: Quiero que el hombre vea . Or quiero que vea el hombre . So, because the order is flexible, we \\ncan’t just put el hombre  afterwards and understand from that I want that he sees the man . If we \\nput el hombre afterwards we will still understand I want that the man sees . So, we need to say al \\nhombre . What was I like, it pleases me ?  \\nS: Me gusta.  \\nT: Me gusta . So, you could say I like that the teacher visits , and here we will use the mood tense after \\nI like that , because again you are casting your subjectivity onto the world and you show that with \\nthis mood tense. I like that the teacher visits . The teacher , we say the professor , so how is that?  \\nS: El profeso r.  \\nT: Good, or for female, for feminine?  \\nS: La profesora.  \\nT: Very good. So, either one. I like that the teacher visits :  \\nS: Me gusta que la profesora visite .T: Very good. Me gusta que la profesora visite  or me gusta que visite la profesora , the or der is \\nflexible. Now, if you wanted to say I like that she visits the teacher , how would that be?  \\nS: Me gusta que visite la profesora.  \\nT: So I still understand from this sentence: I like that the teacher visits , because the order, the word \\norder is not c hanging the information for us, because the word order is flexible. So, me gusta que \\nvisite la profesora , I like that the teacher visits . But, if we want to make it understood I like that \\nhe visits the teacher , how are we going to clear that up?  \\nS: Me gus ta que visite a la profesora.  \\nT: Good. Me gusta que visite a la profesora . Very good. So, to clarify, it’s not just when there might \\nbe some ambiguity that we have to use this personal a, we always need to use this a when the \\nhuman that we mention is havi ng the action of the verb done to them and there is no other \\npreposition present. Now, I say the human, not a human, because it’s when we refer to a specific \\nperson, and whilst this personal a is generally used with humans, we might also see it as a way of  \\npersonifying non -humans, so some people use it with pets, for example, or it can be used in some \\ncreative ways, for example, a la muerte , escapar a la muerte , to escape death, and using this \\npersonal a in this expression personifies death, but generally s peaking, we will use it with humans, \\nand with specific humans, when we are referring to a specific person. So, for example, I need to \\nfind the plumber – there we would use the personal a, I need to find a  plumber – there we wouldn’t. \\nSo, it’s important to listen out for it and to analyze, when you hear it, to understand why it was \\nused, and this is the way we internalize this kind of quite specific details that we find in language. \\nAnd the reason why I keep stressing the importance of listening is to practi ce this thinking process, \\nto practice analyzing the language and becoming our own teachers. This is how language becomes \\nsomething fascinating and pleasant to learn instead of frustrating and painful.',\n",
       " \"Track 72  \\nT: Another place where we use this mood tens e is when we are giving orders to each other, most of \\nthe time, with just one exception which we will look at, we are using this mood tense to give \\norders. For example, if you wanted to say informally don’t speak , you will just say you don’t speak , \\nbut you  will put it in this mood tense. So, how would you say that, don’t speak ?  \\nS: No hables.  \\nT: No hables . Good. Don’t speak. No hables . How would you say don’t stay,  don’t stay , still speaking \\ninformally, so you need to say you don’t stay , and then you jus t switch the ending. So, let’s build \\nit up together, how do you say you don’t stay ?  \\nS: No te quedas.  \\nT: No te quedas . So, this is you don’t stay . But, if you want to make this don’t stay , then you will use \\nthis mood tense.  \\nS: No te quedes.  \\nT: No te q uedes . And then it sounds like Don’t stay! No te quedes. Don’t stay here :  \\nS: No te quedes aquí.  \\nT: Good. No te quedes aquí . The word for there  is ahí, ahí, spelled a-h-í, and there also exists allí, \\nspelled with double l, there’s a tiny, even imperceivable difference between ahí a-h-í and allí a-l-\\nl-i. How would you say don’t stay there , informally ?  \\nS: No te quedes ahí.  \\nT: Good. No te quedes ahí . Good. How would you say don’t give it , speaking informally ? Don't give \\nit:  \\nS: No de s… No lo des.  \\nT: No lo des . Don’t give it to him :  \\nS: No lo des a él.T: Now, if you put a él it’s going to be for clarification purposes, in which case it will be a repetition \\nof something else.  \\nS: No se lo des.  \\nT: No se lo des . Good. No se lo des . Don't give it to him.  What if you wanted to show, clarify or \\nemphasize that it’s to him ?  \\nS: No se lo des a él.  \\nT: Good. No se lo des a él . What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . Now, speaking to more than one person, how would you say : Eat! How would y ou tell \\nmore than one person to eat?  \\nS: Coman .  \\nT: Coman . Good. So, how would you say : Wait! , talking to more than one person?  \\nS: Esperen .  \\nT: Good. Esperen . Now, if you want to say Wait for me , we know already we don’t use for, we just \\nsay me, me. With positive commands, when you’re telling somebody to do something rather than \\nnot to do something, we have these little words like me or lo, breaking the rules that we learned \\nso far about their position – they will come after the changed verb, only w ith positive commands . \\nThis helps our ear tune into the fact that it’s a command. Because other than that  vowel changing, \\nwhich is a very small change which might be quite hard to pick up audibly, we also have these \\nsmall little words like me or lo coming after the verb and that also helps our ear tune into the fact \\nthat it’s a command. So, if you want to say to this more than one person, to this plural you, wait \\nfor me, await me , how will it sound?  \\nS: Espérenme .  \\nT: Espérenme . Good. And it’s writt en like one word as well. Espérenme . How would you say wait \\nfor it , or wait for him , still to more than one person?  \\nS: Espérenlo .T: Espérenlo . Wait for them :  \\nS: Espérenlos .  \\nT: Espérenlos . But, if you were to say don’t wait for them , then we don’t have  it on the end, this is a \\nnegative command. So, don’t wait for them , still to more than one person:  \\nS: No los esperen.  \\nT: Very good. No los esperen . How would you say, speaking formally, eat:  \\nS: Coma .  \\nT: Coma . Good. Eat it :  \\nS: Cómalo .  \\nT: Cómalo . Good , so we have the lo on the end, but if you were to say don’t eat it , still speaking \\nformally:  \\nS: No lo coma.  \\nT: Good. No lo coma.  And speaking informally?  \\nS: No lo comas.  \\nT: No lo comas . And speaking to more than one person?  \\nS: No lo coman.  \\nT: No lo coman . But, if we wanted to say eat it , speaking to more than one person, positive command, \\neat it :  \\nS: Cómanlo .  \\nT: Cómanlo . Very good. To forget was olvidar , olvidar .  \\nS: Olvidar .  \\nT: Olvidar . Related to oblivion  in English actually, oblivion  means like a state of complete forgetting, \\nso we can see the connection there between oblivion  and olvidar . Olvidar  – to forget . Or \\nolvidarse , either, it can be either because olvidar  is a verb where we need to say what is beingforgotten, we need to say it, so if we  use it we have no problem, lo olvido , but if we want to just \\nsay I forget , then we have a problem, because we are not saying what , so we need to say I forget \\nmyself,  me olvido , so it’s a verb that doesn’t like to be alone. So, how would you say forget it , \\nspeaking formally, forget it :  \\nS: Olvídelo .  \\nT: Olvídelo . Good. Now, if you just want to say forget , and we don’t want to say it, this verb \\ndoesn’t like to be alone, so there we would say forget yourself , so how would this be, still \\nformally:  \\nS: Olvídese .  \\nT: Very good. Olvídese . How would you say don’t forget it , speaking informally, don’t forget it ?  \\nS: No lo olvides.  \\nT: Good. No lo olvides . But, if we don’t want to put the lo, we can just say don't forget yourself , don’t \\nforget , so how would that be ?  \\nS: No te olvides.  \\nT: Good. No te olvides.  Or we could do both, we could say no te lo olvides , we could put both, no \\nte lo olvides . How would you say to more than one person don’t forget, you guys don’t forget ?  \\nS: No se olviden.  \\nT: Good. No se olvid en. Don’t forget it , still to plural:  \\nS: No lo olviden.  \\nT: No lo olviden . Good. Or no se lo olviden , you could put them both, meaning doesn’t really change. \\nHow would you say let’s not forget it , how do you think that would be ? Let’s not forget i t:  \\nS: No lo olvidemos.  \\nT: Good. No lo olvidemos. No lo olvidemos . But if you didn’t want to say it, and you just wanted to \\nsay let’s not forget , how would you say it?  \\nS: No nos olvidemos.T: No nos olvidemos . Good. What was to buy ?  \\nS: Comprar .  \\nT: Comprar . How would you say, to more than one person, buy what is missing, what lacks, what is \\nnecessary ? So, what was this missing, lacks, necessary  verb?  \\nS: Faltar .  \\nT: Good. Faltar . So, speaking to more than one person , buy what is missing, what is ne cessary, what \\nlacks :  \\nS: Compren que - que lo.  \\nT: Lo que.  \\nS: Compren lo que falta.  \\nT: Good. Compren lo que falta . You could also say compren lo que hace falta , buy what is making \\nlack, you will hear that as well. So, we are using the mood tense to make c ommands, with one \\nexception. The one exception is with positive informal commands. So, what that means is when \\nwe are speaking informally and we are telling somebody to do something, rather than not to do \\nsomething. The reason why we don’t use the mood ten se here is because we want a shortcut, it’s \\nwhat we do most, to tell people informally what to do. If you think about it, all day you are saying \\nwait here, buy this, call me later, do that and the other , it’s such common speech that it seemed a \\nbit heavy t o use the mood tense for this. So, Spanish took a shortcut, and the shortcut is just \\ndropping the s of the you form of the verb . So, for example, we have comprar , to buy . You buy , \\ninformally, is:  \\nS: Compras .  \\nT: Compras . Now, to make the order, the po sitive order, we just drop the s and we get:  \\nS: Compra .  \\nT: Compra .  \\nS: Which is the same as the he/she/it -T: It’s the same as the he/she/it  form, but it will never cause really any ambiguity for two reasons. \\nFirstly, your tone of voice when you are mak ing an order, the context is always very present, and \\nalso because we’ll be putting our small words, like lo, me, la, after the verb, with the positive \\norders at least, so it’s very obviously an order. But we want to think it through this way, that we \\nare taking off the s, so we keep the association with you informal. So, we have to buy , comprar ; \\nyou buy , informally, compras ; then we want to make an order, which is “get rid of the s”, and we \\nsay compra . How would you say buy it , talking informally ?  \\nS: Cómpralo .  \\nT: Cómpralo . Buy me it :  \\nS: Cómpramelo .  \\nT: Cómpramelo . Good. What was to forget ?  \\nS: Olvidar .  \\nT: Olvidar . How would you say forget it , talking informally ?  \\nS: Olvida .  \\nT: Good, but we need to say what we are forgetting with this on e.  \\nS: Olvídalo .  \\nT: Olvídalo . And if we don’t want to say the lo, we can say:  \\nS: Olvídate .  \\nT: Olvídate . Good. What was to eat ?  \\nS: Comer .  \\nT: Comer . Let’s say eat it , informally:  \\nS: Cómelo .  \\nT: Cómelo . Good. But, don’t eat it , still informally:  \\nS: No lo come.T: So, it’s just the positive commands that we have this shortcut, when we go to negative, we want to \\nuse the mood tense.  \\nS: No lo comas.  \\nT: No lo comas . Good. How would you say eat it , speaking formally? Formally:  \\nS: Cómalo .  \\nT: Cómalo . Goo d. Don’t eat it , still formally:  \\nS: No lo coma.  \\nT: No lo coma . Good. Eat it , speaking plurally, to more than one person, eat it :  \\nS: Cómanlo .  \\nT: Good. Cómanlo . Don’t eat it :  \\nS: No lo coman.  \\nT: No lo coman . Very good. What was to sell ?  \\nS: Vender .  \\nT: Vender . Sell it , speaking informally:  \\nS: Véndelo .  \\nT: Véndelo . Good. But, don’t sell it :  \\nS: No lo vendas.  \\nT: No lo vendas . So, our shortcut is dropping the s of the present for the positive commands, which \\nare informal, it’s something that’s quite spe cific, positive commands informally, but it’s something \\nthat we do all day and that should help us remember that we have this shortcut for it. Callar , c-a-\\nl-l-a-r, callar , means to quiet , and callarse , callarse , means to shut up . So, how would you tell \\nsomebody to shut up , informally ?  \\nS: Cállate .  \\nT: Cállate . Good. Quiet yourself . Good.S: So is it as polite as be quiet , or is it really shut up ?  \\nT: No, it’s not very polite. If you were to speak to more than one person, how would you say it?  \\nS: “Cállente ”, sorry, cállense .  \\nT: Cállense , good, now we need the mood tense. Cállense . Very good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 73  \\nT: So we’ve seen how with orders we want to use this mood tense, with the exception of positive \\norders which are informal. There we have a shortcut, we  can just cut off the s of the informal form. \\nFor example, what is to wait ?  \\nS: Esperar .  \\nT: And what is you wait , informally ?  \\nS: Esperas .  \\nT: Esperas . And wait, the order:  \\nS: Espera .  \\nT: Espera . That’s our shortcut. How would you say let’s wait?  \\nS: Esperemos .  \\nT: Esperemos . Good. And you can also say esperamos , it just sounds less like an order. It would \\nsound more like shall we wait?  ¿Esperamos ? Shall we wait? But then the order, esperemos . Let’s \\nnot wait :  \\nS: No esperemos.  \\nT: No esperemos . Good . So orders, we are using with you, the different versions of you, and with we. \\nBut maybe I want to say what I want him to do, or what I want her to do, or what I want them  to \\ndo. Other than the structures that we learned already, quiero que , prefiero que , etc, we can just \\nsay que and follow it with the subjunctive. So for example, maybe you tell me David is waiting \\nfor you and I say que espere . Que espere . That he waits , but I’m using this mood tense so I’m \\nsaying let him wait . Let him wait . Que espere . Maybe I really want the show to finish. I want the \\nshow to hurry up and finish. I can say que, it finishes in the mood tense and then I get that meaning \\nof let it finish. Hurry up and finish.  So how would I say that? Let it finish :  \\nS: Que termine.T: Que t ermine . Good. Que termine . We said that the word for already  was ya. And we can use that \\nhere, so let it finish already :  \\nS: Que termine ya.  \\nT: Que termine ya . Enough already.  We said that callarse  was to quiet oneself or to shut up . So \\nmaybe you want som ebody to shut up. You’re not angry enough to tell them directly. Maybe you \\nwill just say oh, let them, let him shut up. Let him quiet himself.  How would that be?  \\nS: Que se calle.  \\nT: Good. Que se calle . Another situation that we use the mood tense in, is when after the word \\ncuando , we refer to the future. For example, if I say when we speak  and I mean generally, how \\nwill it sound?  \\nS: Cuando hablamos.  \\nT: Cuando hablamos . So this is generally, when we speak generally and you could continue, no?  \\nBut, if yo u mean in a future event, when we speak later on , then you will use this mood tense. Now \\nthis is a very interesting use of the mood tense because it highlights some kind of superstition \\nmaybe that the language is uncomfortable with referring to something i n the future that didn’t \\nhappen yet as a fact. So you’re putting this mood tense there to kind of highlight that subjectivity. \\nGive me when we speak then. When we speak , and we mean the future. When we speak :  \\nS: Cuando hablemos.  \\nT: Cuando hablemos . We ar e using this mood tense because we are referring to something that’s \\ngoing to happen in the future that we give it as a fact. And it’s like who are we as mere mortals to \\ndo such a thing, to refer to this event or to this fact that will be. So for example, you could say \\nwhen we eat together, we speak . And you mean generally. When we eat together, we speak . What \\nwas together ? Related to junction , related to joint? Related to what in English they say military  \\njunta .  \\nS: Junta .  \\nT: So how would you say when we eat together, we speak ? When we eat together, we speak :S: Cuando comemos junta.  \\nT: Junta  is the version you found through military junta , but you are not just going to take it, you are \\ngoing to have to process it as well. When we eat together :  \\nS: Juntas .  \\nFor two females, that’s fine. So cuando comemos juntas . We speak :  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Good. All together. When we eat together, we speak :  \\nS: Cuando comemos juntas , hablamos .  \\nT: Good. Cuando comemos juntas , hablamos . So here you’re speaking gener ally, generalmente , \\ngenerally. When we eat together , we spea k, but if you want to say when we eat together  and you’re \\nreferring to the future. A fact that you’re naming that hasn’t happened yet, there you want to use \\nyour mood tense. So let’s work our way through it. When we eat together , and we’re referring to \\nthe future:  \\nS: Cuando comamos juntas.   \\nT: We will speak , and we don’t need will with we will speak because the when we eat together is a \\nfuture context. We can just go back to normal everyday presen t again.  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Good. Cuando comamos juntas (two females) when we eat together , hablamos , we will speak . \\nNow hablamos  is just normal present because it is not directly connected to cuando  and we have \\nfuture context already so we can just use hablamos . So if we compare these two sentences, the \\nonly difference is in that mood tense. Cuando comemos juntos , hablamos . This means generally. \\nI went back to male or mixed group. Cuando comemos juntos , hablamos , generally. Cuando \\ncomamos juntos , hablamo s. When we eat together, we will speak.  What is I go or I’m going ?  \\nS: Voy.T: Voy. Now you could probably guess that the mood tense of voy and va and vamos  is irregular. So \\nthe root is vaya , v-a-y-a, vaya . And then we add on our consonants if we need t hem, so for example \\nthe they form or the you plural form would be?  \\nS: Vayan .  \\nT: Vayan . We form:  \\nS: Vayamos .  \\nVayamos . Good. So how would you say we see her when we go , and you’re speaking generally ?   \\nWe see her :  \\nS: La vemos .  \\nT: La vemos . When we g o, generally speaking:  \\nS: Cuando vamos.   \\nT: Good. La vemos cuando vamos . But, if we want to say we will see her when we go , and we’re \\nreferring to the future, not generally. We will see her when we go . How will that be? So, we will \\nsee her , we can just us e the present because when we go is the future context. So, again how is we \\nwill see her ?  \\nS: La vemos .  \\nT: Good. When we go , and we refer now to the future with when we go :  \\nS: Cuando vayamos .  \\nT: Good. La vemos cuando vayamos . So, we have la vemos cuan do vamos  generally, la vemos \\ncuando vayamos  in the future.',\n",
       " 'Track 74  \\nT: So we’ve been seeing the obligatory uses of the mood tense and we will continue to look at some \\nof these uses. To choose is elegir . Elegir .  \\nS: Elegir .  \\nT: Which sounds a little bit l ike:  \\nS: Elect .  \\nT: Yes, elect. Related to elect . Election  in Spanish is elección . I choose from elegir  is elijo, elijo. So \\nwhat happened there?  \\nS: The / e/ became /i/.  \\nT: Yes, the e or the / e/ sound became an i or an / i/ sound. So instead of splitting,  this e just turns into \\nan i. And that happens sometimes in Spanish with a few verbs. When we stress the e, instead of \\nsplitting it will just turn into an i. So here we have elijo. And this just when we stress it. So how \\nwould you say we choose from elegir ?  \\nS: Elegimos .  \\nT: Elegimos . Good. So there the e is not turning into an i because we are not stressing it. Elegimos .  \\nBut in the other places where we stress it, it will. So we have elijo. You, informal. You choose :  \\nS: Eliges .  \\nT: Eliges . Good. So how  would you say I don’t want you to choose for me ? Now when for means on \\nmy behalf, I don’t want you to choose for me, I don’t want you to choose on my behalf , the for that \\nwe use is por. But, maybe we don’t mean on my behalf . Maybe we mean I don ’t want you to \\nchoose something for me . Literally something that is for me . So, in that case we would use para . \\nBut, let’s make the sentence like on my behalf . I don’t want you to choose for me. I don’t want you \\nto choose on my behalf , speaking informally:   \\nS: No quiero que elijas por mí.T: Very good. No quiero que elijas por mí. Good. So por mí is like on my behalf. I don’t want you \\nto take my decisions.  No quiero que elijas por mí. To break  was romper , or romperse  if we say \\nsomething breaks wit hout saying who breaks it. We said that romper  was related to rapture  in \\nEnglish, which also means it’s related to corrupt . The -rupt of corrupt  is rupture , disrupt , erupt .  \\nSo romper  is to break . How would you say I don’t want it to break ? I don’t want it to break :  \\nS: No quiero que rompa.  \\nT: If you say no quiero que rompa  I’m waiting to hear what you don’t want it to break.  \\nS: Lo rompa , ah, not lo rompa -  \\nT: That would be a different sentence -  \\nS: Se rompa .  \\nT: Good. If you were to say no quiero que l o rompa , it would mean I don’t want him or her to break \\nit, or you (formal) to break it. If you say no quiero que se rompa , we are not saying who. We are \\njust saying I don’t want it to break . I don’t want it to break itself , even though we don’t literally \\nmean itself . We said that we can use para , for, para . We can use para  like to, when it’s in order \\nto. So when we have a to in English  which implies in order to , we should put para  in Spanish. \\nWhat was to find ?  \\nS: Encontrar .  \\nT: Encontrar . Encontrarse , encontrarse , to find oneself , is to meet up . To meet up . So how would \\nyou say we have met up or we have found ourselves or each other , which is the same word in \\nSpanish ?  \\nS: Hemos. Nos hemos encontrado .  \\nT: Good. Nos hemos encontrado . We have met up . So we have met up in order to speak. We have \\nmet up to speak. We have met up in order to speak :  \\nS: So, nos hemos encontrado para hablar .  \\nT: Good. Nos hemos encontrado para hablar . Good. So we have met up to speak . And, although \\nwe wouldn’t say in order to s peak  usually in English , if that to speak implies in order to speakthen we will put para  in Spanish. Nos hemos encontrado para hablar . But after para que , so \\nthat, para que , you must use the mood tense. We have cooked in order that they eat. We have \\ncook ed so they eat :  \\nS: Hemos cocinado para que coman .  \\nT: Good. Hemos cocinado para que coman . Good. We have cooked so that they eat . And you can’t \\nmake the shortcut there, of para comer , hemos cocinado para comer , because of course it would \\njust sound like we have cooked in order to eat , in order for us to eat . Good. To go back  or to return  \\nis volver . Volver .  \\nS: Volver .  \\nT: Volver , like in revolve . The -volve  of revolve  is volver  and exists in Spanish, revolver . But in \\nSpanish, revolver  means to stir. Revolv er. So volver  is to return  or to go back or to come back .  \\nHow do you think you would say I return ? I come back or go back :  \\nS: Volvo. Vuelvo.  \\nT: Vuelvo . Good. The o splits. Vuelvo . How would you say you come back or you go back , speaking \\ninformally ?  \\nS: Vuevles .  \\nT: Volver . Take it slowly.  \\nS: Vuelves .  \\nT: Good. Vuelves . Now if you say so that you come back, in order for you to come back, so that you \\ncome back :  \\nS: Para que vuelvas.   \\nT: Good. Para que vuelvas . So you could say something like I’ve done  it so that you come back. I’ve \\ndone it so that you come back . So I have done : the version of hacer  after haber , after any version \\nof haber  is hecho . It’s very irregular. And we said that hecho , the version of hacer  after haber , \\nalso means fact. So I have done , how is it? I have done :  \\nS: He hecho.T: Good. I have done it so that you come back , informally:  \\nS: Lo he hecho para que vuelvas.  \\nT: Good. Lo he hecho para que vuelvas . How would you say I have done it so that they come back ?  \\nS: Lo he hecho par a que vuelvan.  \\nT: Good. Le he hecho para que vuelvan . Good. How would you say they have done it so that we \\ncome back ? They have done it so that we come back :  \\nS: Lo han hecho para que volvamos .  \\nT: Good. Lo han hecho para que volvamos . They have do ne it so that we come back . And I should \\nmention that you might hear para  shortened down in Spanish to pa. So para que would sound \\nlike pa que , pa que volvamos . How much this happens or if it happens at all depends on dialect. \\nSo you will notice it if you hear pa, it’s just para . What was the word for so, like in so tired ?  \\nS: Tan.  \\nT: Tan. And también,  t-a-m-b-i-e-n is as well , also. And it actually has tan inside there. The n turned \\nto an m because of that b, it softened it. So we have tan and t hen bien. También . Just like in \\nEnglish as well . Tan, other than so, can also be translated as as in certain circumstances and then \\nwell, from  as well , bien. So interestingly they are like direct translations of each other. Even though \\nif you think ab out it the direct translation doesn’t make any sense : as well . But it’s the same in \\nEnglish and Spanish. As well , también . So how would you say so that you too, so that you as well \\ncome back,  and let’s speak informally ?  \\nS: Para que tú también vuelvas .  \\nT: Good. Para que tú también vuelvas or para que vuelvas tú también . So how would you say we \\nhave done everything, we have done everything, so that you also come back ? We have done \\neverything so that you also come back :  \\nS: Hemos hecho todo para que tú t ambién vuelvas .  \\nT: Good. Very good. Hemos hecho todo para que tú también vuelvas . Very good.',\n",
       " 'Track 75  \\nT: What was to do or to make ?  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: Hacer . We said that for the informal positive command, we have a shortcut. We find the you \\nversion of th e verb, haces , and we take away the s. “Hace”. But with hacer  we have an irregularity. \\nThe informal command for hacer  is haz. H-a-z. So in most of Spain, you will hear / hath/. Haz.  \\nS: Haz.  \\nT: So if you want to say do it:  \\nS: Hazlo .  \\nT: Hazlo . Good. Anot her use of the mood tense is to turn words like where  into wherever . What was \\nwhere ?  \\nS: Donde .  \\nT: Donde . So of course we can’t use the mood tense with donde  because it’s not a verb. How do you \\nsay where you want , where you want , speaking informally ?  \\nS: Donde quieres .  \\nT: Donde quieres . Good. Now if we want to say wherever you want , then to get wherever actually \\nwe can change the verb to the mood tense and that changes the feeling of where . And then where  \\nturns into wherever . So i f you want to say wherever you want , still informally:  \\nS: Donde queras .  \\nT: I want to hear well though the i and the e in quieras .  \\nS: Donde quieras .  \\nT: Good. Donde quieras . So do it wherever you want :  \\nS: Hazlo donde quieras .  \\nT: Good. Hazlo donde quieras . What was you like it , still informally ? You like it :S: Te gusta .  \\nT: Te gusta . How would you say do it how you like to do it - so do it how you like.  What was the \\nword for how? How are you called? What’s your name? :  \\nS: Cómo .  \\nT: Cómo . Good. So do it how it pleases you. Do it how you like :  \\nS: Hazlo como te gusta.  \\nT: Good. Hazlo como te gusta . Do it how you like to. Do it how you like to do it.  Now, what if you \\nwanted to give the meaning do it however you like ?  \\nS: Hazlo como te guste .  \\nT: Hazlo como te guste . In English we are changing how to however  and in Spanish we are changing \\nte gusta to te guste . Hazlo como te guste . How would you say do what you prefer ? Do what you \\nprefer . Still informal:  \\nS: Haz lo q ue preferes.  \\nT: And:  \\nS: Prefieres .  \\nT: Very good. Haz lo que prefieres . So what we are investigating here is an optional use of the mood \\ntense, no? Because haz lo que prefieres is perfect Spanish. It just means do what you prefer . But \\nif you want to give  the meaning do whatever you prefer how will you change that?  \\nS: Haz lo que prefieras.  \\nT: Good. Haz lo que prefieras . Do whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you prefer. Eat whatever you \\nprefer , speaking informally:  \\nS: Comes lo que prefieras .  \\nT: Comes lo que prefieras would be you eat whatever you prefer . Comes lo que prefieras , which is \\na way of saying it. You could say it like this. Comes lo que prefieras . It just sounds actually alittle sweeter. You eat whatever you prefer , rather than eat whatever you  prefer . But, here we are \\nworking with the order. We have a shortcut where we are not using the mood tense, what is it?  \\nWe have comes , you eat . And what do we do to get the order?  \\nS: Come .  \\nT: Come . Good. So making the order, even though your sentence wa s very nice and very sweet, \\ncomes lo que prefieras . Let’s make it an order. Eat whatever you prefer :  \\nS: Come lo que prefieras.  \\nT: Very good. Come lo que prefieras . Now make this formal. Eat whatever you prefer , but speaking \\nformally:  \\nS: Coma lo que pref iera.  \\nT: Very good. So here we have two mood tenses. We have coma  which is the order and then prefiera , \\ngiving us whatever  from what . Coma lo que prefiera . What if you were speaking to more than \\none person? Eat whatever you prefer :  \\nS: Coman lo que prefie ran.  \\nT: Good. Coman lo que prefieran . Good. What was to need  in Spanish? Sounding more like to \\nnecessitate .  \\nS: Necesitar .  \\nT: Necesitar . Good. Whenever you need . Whenever you need. How do you say that? Speaking \\ninformally:  \\nS: Cuando necesites ?  \\nT: Very good. Cuando necesites . Whenever you need . Good. We said that to choose was like elect .  \\nElegir . Elegir . How would you say I choose ?  \\nS: “Elejo .”  \\nT: And we had some change happening with that e.S: Ahh, yes. Elijo .  \\nT: Elijo . Good. Elijo . You choose , speaking informally:  \\nS: Eliges .  \\nT: Eliges . To follow and also to continue or to carry on , we can use this verb like that, is seguir .  \\nSeguir . So it’s to follow or to continue , to carry on . Seguir .  \\nS: Seguir .  \\nT: And this behaves like elegi r in that the e will not split, it will just turn into an i when we stress it.  \\nSo how do you say I continue or I follow ?  \\nS: Sigo.  \\nT: Sigo. And there are some other verbs that come from seguir . We have conseguir , to get or to \\nmanage to . We have persegu ir which means to chase . And we will see the same irregularity in \\nthem. The I version of conseguir , consigo . Perseguir , persigo . So like we said before, we can \\ngeneralize the irregularities in Spanish. So sigo, I follow, and how about he, she, it follows , or you \\n(formal) follow :  \\nS: Sigue .  \\nT: Sigue . You (informal):  \\nS: Sigues .  \\nT: They or you guys :  \\nS: Siguen .  \\nT: But we:  \\nS: Seguimos .  \\nT: Seguimos . Good. We are not stressing the e so it escapes from the irregularity. Seguimos . Good. \\nSo we could say someth ing like I’ll follow you wherever you go . So, we can say I will follow youor we can just use the present I follow you . Because, the wherever you go is a future context \\ninformally.  \\nS: Te sigo.  \\nT: Te sigo. Good. Wherever you go . So this is actual ly to wherever you go . Wherever you go to, to \\nwherever you go . So how would you say to where ?  \\nS: Adonde   \\nT: Adonde . Good. And you go (informally) and we want the mood tense which is irregular.  \\nS: Is it vaya ?  \\nT: Yes. Very good. So now we can say the whole sentence. I’ll follow you wherever you go. To \\nwherever you go , informally:  \\nS: Te sigo adonde vaya - vayas.  \\nT: Good. Very good. Another irregular verb in the mood tense is ser. The base for the mood tense of \\nser is sea. Sea. S-e-a.  \\nS: Sea.  \\nT: And you’ll hear the very common expression o sea , o sea . Literally meaning something like “or it \\nmight be”. O sea, o sea is just like this kind of way to break up speech whilst you’re thinking what \\nto say like an uhhh . So sea is the base for the  mood tense. So if you want to say something like I \\nprefer that it be like this. I prefer that it’s like this. I prefer for it to be like this. Of course we say \\nI prefer that it be like this . What was the word for like this or like that ?  \\nS: Así.  \\nT: Goo d. So I prefer that it be like this, I prefer it to be like this :  \\nS: Prefiero que lo - do we, no we don’t use lo here.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Prefiero que sea así.  \\nT: Very good. Prefiero que sea así . What does sea lo que sea  mean?S: Whatever will be will be .  \\nT: Whatever it is, whatever will be, will be . Sea lo que sea . Whatever will come.  Good.',\n",
       " 'Track 76  \\nT: The word for there is or there are , there is or there are , in most languages this is a separate verb, \\nbut in English we are expressing it with a combination  of there and is or are. In Spanish, to say \\nthere is or there are we have hay, hay, h-a-y, and hay is actually from haber .  \\nS: Hay.  \\nT: Hay. And for once we have a situation where it’s changing in English and it’s not changing in \\nSpanish: hay means there is or there are , it’s not changing. The word for somebody  is alguien , \\nalguien .  \\nS: Alguien .  \\nT: Good. How would you say there is somebody here that wants to speak with you ? And let’s speak \\nformally, there is somebody here that wants to speak with y ou. So the first bit is there is somebody \\nhere:  \\nS: Hay alguien aquí.   \\nT: Good. That wants to speak with you , speaking formally:  \\nS: Que quiere hablar con usted.   \\nT: Good. Hay alguien aquí que quiere hablar con usted . There is somebody here that wants  to \\nspeak with you . Now, if you say Is there somebody here that speaks Spanish? And you specify \\nwith your subjectivity this thing that we don’t know if it exists or not, this somebody that speaks \\nSpanish, and you do that with this que structure: Is there s omebody here that speaks Spanish , then \\nhere you will use the mood tense, this subjective tense. So, how would you say that ? Is there \\nsomebody here that speaks Spanish? :  \\nS: ¿Hay alguien aquí que hable español ?  \\nT: Very good. ¿ Hay alguien aquí que hable e spañol ? But if somebody replies to you there are two \\npeople that speak Spanish here, there are two people here that speak Spanish , you think you will \\nuse the mood tense?  \\nS: No.T: No, they are just saying what there is! So, there are two people , which in  Spanish is there are two \\npersons , so, there are two people here :  \\nS: Hay dos personas aquí.  \\nT: That speak Spanish:  \\nS: Que hablan español.  \\nT:  Very good. Hay dos personas aquí que hablan español . Very good. The past of hay is había , \\nwhich shows us, actu ally, that hay comes from haber . It’s a very weird historic version of haber . \\nBut había , we see more clearly, that it comes from haber . Now, había  doesn’t change either, so \\nyou will have to resist the temptation to say habían  when you want to say there were instead of \\nthere was , no? It’s always había , doesn’t change. Hay doesn’t change for there is or there are , \\nand había  doesn’t change for there was or there were . So, how would you say There were two \\npeople that spoke Spanish ? Now, this is an intere sting sentence, because in English we will use \\nthe point in the past, there were two people that spoke Spanish , but what do you think we will use \\nin Spanish, the point or the line?  \\nS: The line.  \\nT: Why?  \\nS: Because I’ve heard Spaniards speaking in English , saying it that way.  \\nT: So, you believe that’s the negative language transfer, that’s great! So, it makes sense for it to be \\nthe line in the past, because what we are referring to here is the fact they were Spanish -speakers, \\nand they weren’t Spanish -speakers just for that moment, were they? So if we look at it and we \\nthink about which one fits better, we will choose the line, so again, it’s a great example that we \\ndon’t want to take a direct translation from English, from spoke , we want to just look at th e context \\nand decide if it makes sense to use the line or the point. So, give me this sentence - there were two \\npeople here that spoke Spanish :  \\nS: Había dos personas aquí que hablaban español .  \\nT: Good. Había dos personas aquí que hablaban español . If we were to use the point here – que \\nhablaron español – we wouldn’t be talking about the fact that they are Spanish -speakers, butrather that they spoke Spanish at that time, whatever time we are referring to. We said that hay, \\nthere is or there are ; or había , there was or there were;  comes from haber  in fact. So, when we \\nsay something like there has to be something , and with this be we mean exist, there has to exist \\nsomething , this be is actually coming from there is/there are , not from to be . It’s comi ng from this \\ninvisible verb that we do not have in English, which we make up for by using there is/there are . \\nSo, when we say something like there has to be something that you can eat, there must be \\nsomething that you can do , this be is exist, there must e xist something , in which case it’s haber . \\nIt’s not ser and it’s not estar , and if you try to think which one it is, ser or estar , you will be a \\nlong time trying to work out which one it is. So, how would you say this sentence ? There has to \\nbe som ething that you can do  (let’s speak informally) . There has to be something that you can do .  \\nYou can use has to or must , doesn’t make a lot of difference here.  \\nS: Tiene que hay -  \\nT: But it’s to form, so hay and había  come from?  \\nS: Haber. Tiene que haber.  \\nT: Something that you can do :  \\nS: Algo que puedas hacer.  \\nT: Yes, puedas , very go od. Tiene que haber algo que puedas hacer . Because here, like before with \\nthe example of is there somebody that speaks Spanish , we are speaking about the existence of \\nsomething when we don’t know whether it exists or not, with this structure of hay and que. So, \\nwe are seeing that the mood tense has structural limitations, it can occur only in certain places \\nstructurally, and at the same time only to give certain meaning s or feelings. Now, these meanings \\nor feelings and the fact that Spanish is concerned with us expressing them and perceiving them \\nthrough the language shows the value system of Spanish, or part of the value system of Spanish . \\nNow different languages have different value systems, what a language requires you to express \\nthrough it , and then the other things  that the language might ignore  might be considered its value \\nsystem. And languages, like cultures and individuals, have things they value, things they pay \\nattention to  and things they don’t, which is what makes something like the mood tense so \\nincredibly interesting to analyze and observe and use. So again, not something we want to beobsessed about getting correct, it really is something that we w ant to feel and also understand \\nlogically through our exposure and use of Spanish. We should also bear in mind that the use of the \\nsubjunctive or the mood tense can change slightly depending on dialect and also idiolect, which is \\nthe individual dialect of each person. So, we want to look out for it, listen actively, analyze and \\nenjoy the journey of understanding it and also using it and the different possibilities of expression \\nthat that gives us. It will be a very fascinating insight into the value system of this particular \\nlanguage.',\n",
       " \"Track 77  \\nT: How would you say there should be something to eat ? There should be something to eat - so, we \\nsaid that should  was would owe or would must , so what is to owe , which we can use like must  and \\nit’s related to  debt?  \\nS: Deber .  \\nT: Deber . And would must or would owe gives us the meaning should .  \\nS: Debería .  \\nT: Good. There should be something to eat :  \\nS: Debería haber.   \\nT: Good. Your first place your mind is going to go is to choose between ser and estar . If neither fit, \\nmake that little check, “oh, is this exist? Is this the be that means exist?” And then you know it’s \\nhaber . So, there should be, there should exist something to eat :  \\nS: Debería haber algo comer - para comer.  \\nT: Good, in order to ea t, there should be something in order to eat , good. Debería haber algo para \\ncomer , there should be something to eat . Very good. Another common place that we use the mood \\ntense in Spanish, is when we say it is, an adjective, que, and then a verb. This ve rb is going to go \\ninto the mood tense, you are noticing that que has a lot to do with the subjunctive, that this que \\nintroduces the mood tense in many cases. So, for example, if I want to give you some advice and \\ntell you it’s terrible that you eat this, i t is terrible that you eat this . So, let’s speak informally:  \\nS: Es terrible que comas esto.  \\nT: Good. Es terrible que comas esto . Good. So, it’s the que, the combination of es terrible and que, \\nwhich introduces this mood tense . If you say it is terri ble if you eat this , then you don’t use the \\nmood tense. So, how would you say that? It is terrible if you eat this , still speaking informally:  \\nS: Es terrible si comes esto.  \\nT: Good. Es terrible si comes esto . How would you say it is possible ?S: Es po sible.  \\nT: Good. How would you say It’s possible that we go later ? What is later , or more late ?  \\nS: Más tarde.  \\nT: Good. And what is the root for the mood tense of go? Voy, va becomes:  \\nS: Vaya .  \\nT: Good. So, it is possible that we go later :  \\nS: Es posib le que vayamos más tarde.  \\nT: Good. Es posible que vayamos más tarde . Fuerte  in Spanish means strong , but it’s also used \\ncolloquially and maybe the closest translation that I can think of would be something like, I mean, \\nagain it’s very colloquial, but you  can say oh, that’s hardcore, that’s full -on, in Spanish you say a \\nlot qué fuerte , qué fuerte , how heavy, how hardcore, how full -on, qué fuerte . And we see that \\nwe can use qué like how – qué fuerte ; qué lindo , how nice, how beautifu l; qué bueno , how good. \\nYou can say qué increíble que  or qué fuerte que , so, whilst we have two que’s there in Spanish, \\nthis is just how incredible that, how hardcore that , and, of course, we will carry on into the mood \\ntense. So, how strong, h ow heavy, that he is here , how would you say that?  \\nS: Qué fuerte que esté aquí.  \\nT: Good. Qué fuerte que esté aquí . In English we achieve a similar feeling to what we get with the \\nSpanish subjunctive sometimes with words like should  or might . Here for example, in English we \\ncould say how incredible that he should come , here we don’t mean should , like in its literal \\nmeaning like debería , no, here in English we are using should  to give this kind of mood tense \\nfeeling: how incredible that he sh ould come . Está bien , está bien , means it’s okay. The literal \\ntranslation of bien is well, and to be well is a state, so it goes with estar : está bien , but it can also \\nbe used like it’s okay . So for example, you could say, you know, it’s okay that you  ask but I don’t \\nhave to reply . So, to ask is preguntar , and to reply or to respond is responder . So, we will say \\nit’s okay that you ask, but it’s not necessary that I respond, I don’t need to respond, it’s not \\nnecessary that I respond . So, the first bit – it’s okay that you ask , and we are speaking informally, \\nand to ask  was preguntar :S: Está bien que preguntes.  \\nT: Good. Está bien que preguntes . So, it’s like okay, you can ask as much as you like , so this is the \\nfeeling we get here with the mood tense, or in English we might use might  here to get this kind of \\nmood tense feeling: it’s okay that you might ask. But :  \\nS: Pero .  \\nT: It’s not necessary that I respond, I don’t need to respond, it’s not necessary that I respond , there's \\na few ways we can say this :  \\nS: No es necesito.  \\nT: Necesito  is the verb.  \\nS: Necesidad ?  \\nT: Is necessity . So, necessary . How is vocabulary  in Spanish?  \\nS: Ah , wait, necesario .  \\nT: Good. So, it’s not necessary that I respond :  \\nS: No es necesario que responda.  \\nT: Very good. Está bien que preguntes , pero no es necesario que responda . And there we have \\nthe mood tense after es necesario , or no es necesario que , so we have it is, adjective, que, and \\nthen the verb, and that verb with the mood tense. We also could have said no hace falta que \\nresponda , it doesn’t make lack , this common expression we said that we will hear around, hacer \\nfalta , no hace falta que responda . How would you say it is important that we find it soon ? It’s \\nimportant that we find it soon :  \\nS: Es impo rtante que lo encontremos pronto.  \\nT: Good. Es importante que lo encontremos pronto . Good.\",\n",
       " \"Track 78  \\nT: What was to follow or to continue, to carry on ?  \\nS: Seguir .  \\nT: Seguir . And how was I continue or I carry on or I follow ?  \\nS: Sigo.  \\nT: Sigo. Good.  If you want to say I continue speaking,  here we use the -ing, I continue speaking , so \\nhow would that be?  \\nS: Sigo hablando.  \\nT: Sigo hablando . He continues speaking :  \\nS: Sigue hablando.  \\nT: Sigue hablando . He continues speaking, she continues speaking, yo u (formal ) continue speaking. \\nIt’s probable that he continues speaking . So, in English we will probably say he’ll probably \\ncontinue speaking , but in Spanish it is probable that he continues speaking . So, how would that \\nbe?  \\nS: Es probable que siga habl ando.  \\nT: Very good. Es probable que siga hablando . Good. It is probable that he continues speaking. So, \\nafter seguir to get the meaning of continue we can use the -ing. What was to be for characteristics?  \\nS: Ser.  \\nT: Ser. Good. How would you make the -ing form of ser?  \\nS: Siendo .  \\nT: Siendo . Free, in the sense of not requiring any money, is gratis  in Spanish.  \\nS: Gratis .T: This is where we get gratuitous  from in English. It’s a bit gratuitous, it’s unnecessary, it’s free, it’s \\nextra. Gratis . So, you can  say it’s imperative that it continues to be free . So, it’s imperative that it \\ncontinues being free , how would you say that?  \\nS: Es imperativo que siga siendo gratis.  \\nT: Good. Es imperativo que siga siendo gratis . To start , we said that we had comenzar  and \\nempezar . Comenzar  is, of course, easier to remember and use, because it sound s like commence , \\nbut empezar  is probably more common. So, you can use whichever you like now. How would you \\nsay it’s spectacular that they start to speak Spanish ? Now, aft er start, to connect to the next to \\nform you need a. There are just a handful of verbs that are not verbs of movement, for example, \\nlike ir, volver , salir, that need a to connect, apart from these there are just a handful of verbs that \\nuse some preposition  to connect, and empezar  and comenzar  are two of them. So, how would \\nyou say it’s spectacular that they begin to speak Spanish (spectacular  is the same word in \\nSpanish )?  \\nS: Es “spectacular ”,  \\nT: Almost the same word.  \\nS: Oh, right, espectacular .  \\nT: Go od, es espectacular , that they begin :  \\nS: Que comienzen a hablar español.  \\nT: Good. Es espectacular que comienzen a hablar español . It's spectacular that they start to speak \\nSpanish . Now, after comenzar  and empezar  you could also put the -ing form, and the  meaning \\nwould change a little, it would mean it’s spectacular that they start out speaking Spanish . Now, in \\nEnglish there is not a lot of difference, that they begin to speak Spanish, that they begin speaking \\nSpanish , both in English mean to start speakin g Spanish. But in Spanish, if you use the -ing here \\nit would mean that they start out speaking Spanish, like right from the beginning . So, when I’m \\nspeaking about these courses for example, I say that we start out speaking Spanish, right from the \\nbegin ning. Now , speaking about that in Spanish I would use the -ing here. So, it’s spectacular that \\nthey start out speaking Spanish :  \\nS: Es espectacular que comienzen hablando español.T: Good. And here we don’t need the a, because we are not connecting t o a to form. What was the \\nverb to finish or to terminate ?  \\nS: Terminar .  \\nT: Terminar . Now, if you want to say a sentence like I want you guys to speak with me when you \\nfinish selling them , we will say when you finish to sell them . Here you won’t u se the -ing, but to \\nfinish , terminar , is also one of those verbs that needs a preposition to connect to the next to form . \\nIn this case the preposition is de. So, to finish selling them is terminar de vender . So, I want you \\nguys to speak with me when y ou finish selling them , so the first bit is I want you guys to speak with \\nme, how is that bit?  \\nS: Quiero que hablen conmigo.  \\nT: Good, mood tense, quiero que hablen conmigo . Good. I want that you talk with me, quiero que \\nhablen conmigo , when you finish se lling them . So, when you finish , and we are still speaking to \\nyou guys:  \\nS: Cuando terminen,  \\nT: Good, why did you use the mood tense there – cuando terminen ?  \\nS: Because it’s the future when .  \\nT: Good. When cuando  refers to generally , we won’t use the  mood tense, we just use the present, \\nand here, referring to a future event that hasn’t happened, after cuando , we use the mood tense, \\nwell remembered. Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen , when you finish selling them , \\nand we are not going to use selling, we are going to use to sell , and we connect that with de:  \\nS: Cuando terminen de venderlos.  \\nT: Good, so altogether – I want you guys to speak with me when you finish selling them :  \\nS: Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen de venderlos.  \\nT: Good.  Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen de venderlos . So this means I want you \\nguys to speak with me when you finish selling them , but terminar  we can also use like end up : I \\nwant you guys to speak with me when you end up selling them . So, using the -ing form afterterminar , instead of de and the to form, gives us this meaning of “end up”. So, if you wanted to \\nsay, I want you guys to speak with me when you end up selling them , so I want you guys to speak \\nwith me :  \\nS: Quiero que hablen conmigo.  \\nT: When y ou end up selling them , so we will say when you finish and then we will actually use the -ing:  \\nS: Cuando terminen vendiéndolos.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que hablen conmigo cuando terminen vendiéndolos . I want you guys to speak \\nwith me when you end up selling them . So, there is a difference here, depending on whether we \\nuse the to form or the -ing form, just as we saw with empezar  or comenzar , there can be a \\ndifference between using the to form afterwards or the -ing form afterwards, and both of them need \\na preposi tion to join the to form, which might be a clue to you that there is a difference between \\nusing the to form and then the -ing form. If the to form is joining with a preposition, then maybe \\nthis particular verb takes the -ing form afterwards as well with a slightly different meaning. \\nEmpezar a hablar , to start to speak , to start speaking ; empezar hablando , to actually begin \\nsomething speaking , or, as we would probably say, to start out speaking ; terminar de vender , to \\nfinish selling ; terminar vendiendo , to end up selling . So, what we have aimed to teach here is the \\nidea of the mood tense, the general feeling of the mood tense, and the kind of constructions in \\nwhich it occurs, and, like I said, understanding the mood tense is about listening out for it, and \\nlistening out for how people around you use it. A great way to learn it is to chat online, for example, \\nbecause maybe in real life, and almost certainly at the beginning, you won’t pick up those subtle \\nchanges in vowels that you get with the mood tense. But if you are chatting online you will notice \\nquite clearly, “ah, there they used an a and not an e, or there they used an e and not an a, oh why?” \\nAnd then you will look at the context of the sentence and work out why the mood tense was used \\nand that really is the best way to internalize it.\",\n",
       " 'Track 79  \\nT: So let’s make a little re cap of some of the situations in which we are using the mood tense with a \\nnew verb, dejar . Dejar . Dejar  means to leave , but in the sense of to leave a message , rather than \\nleave , to go out like salir . Dejar .  \\nS: Dejar .  \\nT: Dejar . Good. How would you say leave me a message , speaking formally? A message is un \\nmensaje . Un mensaje.  \\nS: Déjeme un mensaje.  \\nT: Good. Déjeme un mensaje . And, of course, positive command, we have the me, me, after the \\nverb, déjeme un mensaje . How would you say I want you to leave me a message , speaking \\ninformally? I want you to leave me a message :  \\nS: Quiero que me dejes un mensaje.  \\nT: Good. Quiero que me dejes un mensaje . In the same way, if you were to say I want to tell him to \\nleave me a message , you won’t say I want to tell him to leave me a message  literally, you will say \\nI want to tell him that he leaves me a message . What is to say or to tell ?  \\nS: Decir .  \\nT: Decir . Good, so, I want to tell him  is the f irst bit.  \\nS: Quiero decirle.  \\nT: That he leaves me a message :  \\nS: Que deje - me deje un mensaje.  \\nT: Good. Quiero decirle que me deje un mensaje . So, you don’t want to tell him that he is leaving \\nyou a message, you want to tell him to leave you a message, so here we use the mood tense. If you \\nwere to say quiero decirle que me deja un mensaje  what would be understood there without the \\nmood tense is I want to tell him that he, she , or you ( formal)  is leaving me a message , but if youuse here your mood tense, then it’s understood there that sense of order, and you will understand \\nI want to tell him to leave me a message , quiero decirle que me deje un mensaje . Good.  \\nWhen he leaves you the message, call me  (let’s speak informally) ; when he leaves you the messag e, \\ncall me :  \\nS: Cuando te deje el mensaje.  \\nT: Good. Cuando te deje el mensaje , call me , informally, so, it’s our shortcut.  \\nS: Llámame .  \\nT: Good. Cuando te deje el mensaje , or cuando él te deje el mensaje , if you wanted to clarify, \\nllámame . Good. So, afte r cuando , when we are referring to the future, when we are referring to \\nsomething that hasn’t happened yet, we feel a bit superstitious about it and we want to use our \\nmood tense. Cuando te deje el mensaje , llámame . It’s essential  that he sees my message.  It is \\nessential - the -tial here, what do you think might happen to it in Spanish? Like the -tion, like in \\ntradition , becomes:  \\nS: Tradición .  \\nT: So, something similar might happen here.  \\nS: Esencial .  \\nT: Well done, esencial . Spacial  - espacial , good. So, it’s essential that he sees my message :  \\nS: Es esencial que.  \\nT: He sees my message , it’s based on the irregularity of veo, the I version:  \\nS: Vea.  \\nT: Good. So, it’s essential that he, or she, or you ( formal)  see my message :  \\nS: Es ese ncial que vea mi mensaje.  \\nT: Good. Es esencial que vea mi mensaje . Good. Ojalá  in Spanish means something like hopefully . \\nOjalá .  \\nS: Ojalá .T: You will hear it a lot, ojalá , and there are a lot of versions of the history of where it came from . \\nWhat it’s definitely got something to do with is “Allah”, the Arabic word for God, or the god , \\nAllah, and the south of Spain was part of the Muslim world for around eight centuries, so we have \\na lot of Arabic words and structures and habits in Spani sh, and one of them is this popular \\nexpression ojalá . And there are a lot of versions of where it came from exactly, although my \\nfavorite is that it’s a contraction of “ojo -Allah”, ojo means eye, and it’s still used in some places, \\nlike watch out!  Ojo! Careful, watch it, beware , so it’s like “ojo -Allah”, so you say it when you \\nwant something, “ojo -Allah” , I want this , ojalá , hopefully. Although that’s just one version of \\nwhere ojalá  came from. So, after ojalá  you can use the mood tense to say what you wa nt to happen, \\nso, you can say for example, hopefully she will leave a message , or she leaves a message , using \\nyour mood tense . Hopefully she leaves a message :  \\nS: Ojalá deje un mensaje.  \\nT: Good, ojalá deje un mensaje . How would you say hopeful ly it will be soon ? When something \\nhappens is a characteristic of it, so if you want to say hopefully it ’s soon , we need to use that \\nirregular root of ser that we have in the mood tense, do you remember how that is, and it’s like the \\npopular expression t hat we have in Spanish, that you might hear a lot, which begins o.  \\nS: O sea.  \\nT: Good. Hopefully it is soon, hopefully it will be soon :  \\nS: Ojalá sea pronto.  \\nT: Good. Ojalá sea pronto . Good. So, ojalá  you will hear and want to use very often, and also yo u \\nuse with this subjective tense. So, like we said, you just want to listen out for when the mood tense \\nis used, get interested in it, analyze why it’s been used, think about why it’s been used, think about \\nhow that fits in to the image and the vision that  you are getting of the mood tense and how and \\nwhy it’s used. It’s something that you should enjoy and analyze and the most interesting areas \\nmight be the optional uses, because with the optional uses of the mood tense you can really give \\nmany different to nes to what you are saying, whether it’s humor, or sarcasm, or sincerity, irritation \\n– there is a whole spectrum of feelings you can express with it. And these are best understood \\nexplored in a live environment – practicing, listening to and analyzing Span ish.',\n",
       " 'Track 80  \\nT: We saw many uses for se, the sound / se/. We have sé as a verb, yo sé , from saber , I know , and this \\nsé is written with a written accent sé or yo sé , or we said lo sé is very common, I know it , just \\nbecause sé, sé, sé is a little short, so  you might hear lo sé, lo sé, lo sé, I know it . And then we have \\nthe grammatical se which we’ve seen as self – himself, herself, themselves, yourself speaking \\nformally, itself, oneself . So, for example, you can say he stays , or he remains himself :  \\nS: Se queda.  \\nT: Se queda . Good. So, this is the se that we have for him/her/you (formal )/it/themselves . And then \\nwe also had a se which was when we have two /l/’s together – the first one, the personal one will \\nturn into se only because Spanish doesn’t li ke phonetically the sound of having these two /l/’s \\ntogether . So, for example, if you had a verb like to prepare , what is to prepare ?  \\nS: Preparar .  \\nT: Preparar . And I prepare :  \\nS: Preparo .  \\nT: Preparo . I prepare it :  \\nS: Lo preparo.  \\nT: And I prepare  them it , I prepare it for them or I prepare them it :  \\nS: Se lo preparo.  \\nT: Se lo preparo . Good, this les turns into se, because we can’t have les lo . So, we’ve seen these uses \\nof se so far – the grammatical se for self and then also this phonetic c hange. We have one more \\nuse for se to see, one more use for se. Now, when we combine se with me, te, le, les, nos, we get \\nthe meaning of on me in English, in the sense of it died on me , maybe the computer breaks down \\nand you say it died on me . So you can s ay it died on me , it ran out on me , so you have this on me \\nstructure in English, which you can use with only some verbs . Now , in Spanish you can do this as \\nwell, only it’s much more common and it’s not restricted to just a few verbs. Adding se and the n \\nme/te/nos/le/les. So, for example, the door was la puerta , la puerta , and to close was cerrar ,cerrar , so, if you want to say the door closes  you will say the door closes itself , so let’s make that \\nfirst, how would you say that ?  The door closes i tself:  \\nS: La puerta se cierra.   \\nT: Good. La puerta se cierra or se cierra la puerta – it’s flexible. Now, if you want to say the door \\ncloses on me , se me cierra la puerta . So maybe the door keeps closing by itself and you want to \\ngive that on me  feeling la puerta se me cierra , se me cierra la puerta , either are okay.  \\nTo burn in Spanish is quemar , q-u-e-m-a-r. Quemar .  \\nS: Quemar .  \\nT: Quemar . So, if you want to say the dinner burns , the dinner gets burned , what was the dinner or \\nto dine ?  \\nS: Cenar .  \\nT: Cenar. So, cenar  was to have dinner or to dine , and the dinner , the noun, how was it?  \\nS: Cena .  \\nT: La cena . Good. So, it burns itself the dinner, the dinner gets burned :  \\nS: La cena se quema.  \\nT: La cena se quema . Now, if you want to say the dinner burns on  me, the dinner is burning on me , \\nhow would you make that meaning?  \\nS: La cena se me quema.  \\nT: La cena se me quema, se me quema la cena . So, you don’t have to worry about using this \\nstructure for now, until you are really comfortable with all of these lit tle words like me, lo, le, las, \\nand se, etc, all of these, but you will hear it, so we are looking at this just briefly now, so it doesn’t \\ncause any confusion when you hear it. When you have this extra se, and you know it’s extra, \\nbecause it’s coming wi th me/te/nos/le, it shouldn’t cause any confusion if you hear se me , se nos , \\nse te, then you understand what is happening. Acabar , acabar , is to finish or to run out . Acabar .  \\nS: Acabar .T: Good. A-c-a-b-a-r.  \\nS: Acabar .  \\nT: How would you say the battery  runs out, or the battery runs itself out ? The battery  is la batería , \\nla batería :  \\nS: La batería se acaba.  \\nT: Good. La batería se acaba . If you want to say oh, my battery always runs out , you are talking \\nabout your phone and your battery is always r unning out, you can say my battery, the battery , like \\nwe said we don’t use my as much in Spanish as we do in English, the battery always runs out on \\nme, the battery always runs out on me , what was the word for always ?  \\nS: Siempre .  \\nT: Good, so let’s try this sentence. The battery always runs out on me :  \\nS: La batería siempre se me acaba.  \\nT: Very good. La batería siempre se me acaba . How would you ask Does the battery run out on \\nyou? Speaking informally, Does the battery run out on you? :  \\nS: ¿La batería s e te acaba?   \\nT: Good. ¿ La batería se te acaba ? Good. And what if you were speaking formally?  \\nS: ¿La batería se le acaba ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ La batería se le acaba ? We use le, because it’s on you , the battery runs out on you , so, \\nnot using lo, using le – to you, o n you, from you, for you – all included there in le. And if you are \\nspeaking to more than one person:  \\nS: La batería se les acaban , no, se les acaba .  \\nT: Good, very good. La batería se les acaba . Good. So, if you hear this extra se around – you know \\nwhat i t’s doing. Quemar  was to burn , how would you say it burned , it burned ?  \\nS: Quemó .  \\nT: Quemó . Now, what if you wanted to say the dinner got burned ?S: La cena se quemó.  \\nT: Good. La cena se quemó , se quemó la cena , the dinner got burned . Now, how would  you say the \\ndinner burned on me, the dinner got burned on me ?  \\nS: La cena se me quemo - se me quemó .  \\nT: Good. La cena se me quemó, se me quemó la cena . The dinner burned on us :  \\nS: La cena se nos quemó .  \\nT: Good. La cena se nos quemó , very good.',\n",
       " \"Track 81  \\nT: How would you say I don't want the door to close on me ? So what was to close ?  \\nS: Cerrar .  \\nT: And the door :  \\nS: La puerta.  \\nT: La puerta . Which is related to port. Of course, you stress down on the o of port and you get \\npuerto . Puerto  is port. And you change the o to an a and you get puerta , door . So, I don't want \\nthe door to close on me :  \\nS: No quiero la puerta - Oh. I don't want that the door closes on me.   \\nT: Exactly.  \\nS: No quiero que la puerta se me cierre.  \\nT: Very good. After quiero qu e, no quiero que , we're using the mood tense. No quiero que la puerta \\nse me cierre . Or no quiero que se me cierre la puerta . Good. How do you say again , or another \\ntime?  \\nS: Otra vez.  \\nT: Good. I don't want the door to close on me again :  \\nS: No quiero qu e la puerta se me cierre otra vez.  \\nT: Good. No quiero que la puerta se me cierre otra vez . What was the verb to return or to come \\nback ? And it's related to revolve .  \\nS: Volver .  \\nT: Volver . Good. Volver . Instead of saying otra vez , another way of saying again in Spanish is to \\nuse volver . So, for example, it closes again , we can say vuelve a cerrarse . It returns to close .  \\nWhy do we have a here? Vuelve a cerrarse?  \\nS: Because it's a verb of movement.T: Good. So how would you say I don't want the door to cl ose again , with volver , how would it be?  \\nSo let's take it from the beginning. I don't want that :  \\nS: No quiero que.  \\nT: The door returns :  \\nS: La puerta vuelva.  \\nT: Very good. To close itself :  \\nS: A cerrarse.  \\nT: Good. No quiero que la puerta vuelva a cerr arse. Or no quiero que vuelva a cerrarse la puerta . \\nSo volver  a can be used like again , and it's very common in Spanish. You might hear it around. \\nSo if you say I don't want it to happen again , for to happen you can use to pass . What was to pass ? \\nOr if you don't remember, you can make a guess here.  \\nS: Pasar .  \\nT: Pasar . Or occur , ocurrir . You can use that as well, for happen . Suceder , succession , suceder . All \\nof these mean to happen . Pasar  is probably easier, and easier to remember. So, I don't wa nt it to \\nhappen again. I don't want it to return to happen :  \\nS: No quiero que vuelva a pasar.  \\nT: Good. No quiero que vuelva a pasar . Good. So we saw that we have the mood tense with which \\nwe are switching the vowel, so we go from vuelve  to vuelva  to get the mood tense. Or we have \\ncerrar  and we go from cierra  to cierre  to get the mood tense. We only have mood tense in the \\npresent and in the past. It doesn't exist in the futures. It used to, and there are a couple of words \\nleft behind in fixed expressio ns that still have this form. But for all intents and purposes, it doesn't \\nexist any more in Spanish, the future mood tense. We have the present, which we've practiced and \\nhave a very good hold on, and the past mood tense. Now, the past mood tense is very easy to build. \\nWe will always build it going from the they form of the point in the past. And now that I've \\nmentioned the point in the past, I should also mention that the mood tense for the past is the same \\nfor the line and the point. There are no two dif ferent ones. It counts for both. And we build it goingfrom the point in the past for they. So for example, if we take a verb like to speak , hablar , and \\nthey spoke :  \\nS: Is it hablaron ?  \\nT: Yes, hablaron . So that's the first step to find the mood tense for the past, is to go to the they form \\nfor the point in the past, hablaron . So you find hablaron  and you change that last o to an a and \\nwhat do you get?  \\nS: Hablaran .  \\nT: Hablaran . And that is your mood tense for they in the past. Now from that, we can work b ackwards \\nto find the I, he, she, it, you ( formal) version. If we work backwards from hablaran , what would \\nwe do to work backwards from hablaran , what would we get rid of?  \\nS: The n, hablara .  \\nT: Hablara . And then we can make the you (informal) version:  \\nS: Hablaras .  \\nT: Good. And we, and the accent won't move.  \\nS: Habláramos .  \\nT: Habláramos . Good. So that's your set. We can do the same now with comer . What was they ate , \\nthe point in the past?  \\nS: Comieron .  \\nT: Comieron , good. So now give me the mood tense v ersion of they ate :  \\nS: Comieran .  \\nT: Comieran . Good. And I ate, he, she, it, you  (formal) ate:  \\nS: Comiera .  \\nT: Good. We:  \\nS: Comiéramos .T: Comiéramos . And you (informal):  \\nS: Comieras .  \\nT: Comieras . So this is how we form our mood tense in th e past. We want to go from the they form. \\nSo we use this pretty much in the same kind of situations that we use the present mood tense. Just \\nin the past, with a couple of situations that are specifically for past. So for example, where quiero \\nque necessita tes the mood tense in the present, quería que , I wanted that , will necessitate the \\nmood tense in the past. What is I wanted , using the line in the past?  \\nS: Quería .  \\nT: So now you could say something like I wanted them to eat with us. I wanted that they at e with us .  \\nAnd that they ate of course will be in the mood tense. I wanted that they ate with us :  \\nS: Quería que comieran con nosotros.  \\nT: Good. Quería que comieran con nosotros . And as we said, point in the past, line in the past, \\nwhen it comes to the m ood tense, it's the same. I was hoping that he would call me. I was hoping :  \\nS: Esperaba que.  \\nT: That he would call me.  So, I was hoping that , we don't say would , we use the past mood tense \\nagain. I was hoping that he called me :  \\nS: Esperaba que me llamar a.  \\nT: Good. Esperaba que me llamara . So whilst in English we would say I was hoping that he would \\ncall me , in Spanish I was hoping that he called me , and we use the past mood tense.  \\nEsperaba que me llamara . Good. What was to need or to necessitate ?  \\nS: Necesitar .  \\nT: Good. Necesitar . How would you say we needed , using the line in the past? We needed, we were \\nneeding :  \\nS: Necesitábamos .T: Good. Necesitábamos . How would you say we needed to speak with him ? We needed to spe ak \\nwith him :  \\nS: Necesit ábamos que-  \\nT: Why que? We needed to speak :  \\nS: Necesitábamos hablar.  \\nT: With him :  \\nS: Con él.  \\nT: Good. So here we don't need the mood tense. Necesitábamos hablar con él . We needed to spe ak \\nwith him . But, if you were to say we needed that he speak with us , we needed that he spoke with \\nus, then this that, this que is what most of the time in Spanish is alerting you that maybe you want \\nto use the mood tense. So, we needed that he speak with us, how is that?  \\nS: Necesit ábamos que hablara con nosotros.  \\nT: Very good . Necesit ábamos que hablara con nosotros . Very good. What was to return , and we \\nsaid that we can also use this verb like again ?  \\nS: Volver .  \\nT: Volver . So if I wanted to say I called you again , I could just say I returned to call you . It's got \\nnothing to do with actually returning, ah? It's just a way of saying again . So what is I returned , \\nfrom to return , from volver :  \\nS: Volvá .  \\nT: Go back to comer :  \\nS: Volví .  \\nT: Good. So I called you again , speaking informally:  \\nS: Volví a llamarte.  \\nT: Good. Volví a llamarte . To organize. In order to organize :S: Para organizar.  \\nT: Good. So all together, I called you again in order to organize , speaking informally:  \\nS: Volví a llamarte para organizar.  \\nT: Good. Volví a llamarte para organizar . So, if we have para organizar , we don't need to worry \\nabout the mood tense. And we can sometimes adjust our sentence , putting to forms so that we can \\navoid finding the mood ten se. So you could say something like volví a llamarte para organizar , \\nvolví a llamarte para organizar , I called you again in order to organize , and there you don't need \\nthe mood tense. But if you were to say I called you again so that, in order that, we org anized , then \\nthere you would have to use the mood tense. So how would that be? I called you again , informally \\nstill:  \\nS: Volví a llamarte.  \\nT: So that :  \\nS: Para que.  \\nT: We organized . So it's the mood tense now, in the past:  \\nS: Organizaron. Organizaran. O rganizáramos.  \\nT: Very good. Very good. So you have to take a trip through, ah, to find it. And it's quite time \\nconsuming at the beginning. But once you start practicing this past mood tense, of course it \\nbecomes much quicker to find these different forms.  Volví a llamarte para que organizáramos.  \\nAnd like I said, you can even avoid the use of the mood tense just by saying volví a llamarte para \\norganizar , in a structure like this one, for example. So we're seeing that there are similar structures \\nto the stru ctures we practiced the mood tense in the present with, just in the past.\",\n",
       " \"Track 82   \\nT: We also said that when we use ser or estar , with an adjective plus que - so for example, es \\nrelevante que , it's relevant that , está bien que , it's okay that - we will f ollow this up with the \\nmood tense. So how would you say for example, it's not very relevant that they found it , it's not \\nvery relevant that they found it , for example ? So how is it's not very relevant :  \\nS: No es muy relevante.  \\nT: Good. That they found i t:  \\nS: Que encontraron, encontraran, lo encontraran .  \\nT: Good. No es muy relevante que lo encontraran . So here we're not starting with the past, are we? \\nNo es muy relevante . That's the present. But after que we refer back to the past, so we can use \\nthe pas t mood tense. In the same way, we could use the present mood tense. We could say it's not \\nvery relevant that they find it , that they might find it , using the present mood tense. So how would \\nthat sound?  \\nS: No es muy relevante que lo encuentren.  \\nT: Good. No es muy relevante que lo encuentren . Good. How would you say it wasn't very relevant ? \\nNow , the line (we can use the line in the past here) from ser is irregular. But, we can remember \\nthe word era in English, to remember this line in the past from ser. Because a line in the past is an \\nera, and if we pronounce era as if it was Spanish, we get:  \\nS: Era.  \\nT: Era. And that's the line in the past from ser. So how would you say it was very relevant ?  \\nS: Era muy relevante.  \\nT: Good. It was very relevant th at they found it. It was very relevant that they found it:   \\nS: Era muy relevante que lo encontraran.  \\nT: Good. So, we want to identify the structures that allow us to use the mood tense, other than to use \\nthe mood tense correctly, to also avoid it sometime s. No? So imagine you're having a conversationand you just want to get the meaning across and the point across, and maybe you don't want to \\nworry in that moment about finding the mood tense. You just have something you need to say, and \\nyou will worry abou t it later how it would be with the mood tense. So we can play around with the \\nstructure as we did, for example, with volví a llamarte para organizar . I called you again to \\norganize , instead of volví a llamarte para que organizáramos . I called  you again so that we \\norganized . Like we did there, we can play around a little bit with the structure to avoid using the \\nmood tense. So for example, instead of saying es importante que , we could also say the important \\nthing is that . And when we say the im portant thing is that , what we end up with is es que . So, we \\nsaid that we have a useful structure we can use to give this the important thing . So instead of saying \\nla cosa importante , which would be a literal translation of the important thing , how could w e \\nmake that structure using lo?  \\nS: Just say lo importante ?  \\nT: Yes, lo importante . Good. So we said that instead of saying literally the important thing , you can \\njust use lo. With any adjective, and you get this idea of the important thing . Lo importante , the \\nimportant thing . Lo increíble , the incredible thing . Lo espectacular , the spectacular thing . Es \\nque, and then after that es que , you don't need any mood tense. So, incredible  is increíble , slightly \\ndifferent in Spanish than in English. We don't have t he d, and we can actually see where incredible \\ncomes from. To believe in Spanish was creer . And creíble would be believable . And increíble is \\nunbelievable . So incredible actually means unbelievable . Increíble .  \\nS: Increíble .  \\nT: So first, if we say it's in credible that , then we will want the mood tense. So, it's incredible that they \\ncome back,  that they return . What was to return ?  \\nS: Volver .  \\nT: Volver . Good. So, it's incredible that they return, that they come back :  \\nS: Es increíble que vuelvan.  \\nT: Goo d. Es increíble que vuelvan . But, if you wanted to avoid going through that, you could just \\nsay the incredible thing is that they come back . And there you don't need the mood tense. So, the \\nincredible thing :S: Lo increíble.  \\nT: Is that they return :  \\nS: Es que vuelven.  \\nT: Good. Lo increíble es que vuelven . The incredible thing is that they come back . How would you \\nsay the incredible thing is that they do it again ? And we will use the structure with volver  to say \\nagain . So, the incredible thing is that the y return to do it . What was to do or to make ?  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: Good. The incredible thing is that they do it again. The incredible thing is that they return to do it :  \\nS: Lo increíble es que vuelven a hacerlo.  \\nT: Very good. Lo increíble es que vuelven a h acerlo . The incredible thing is that they do it again .  \\nBut what if you were to say it is incredible that they do it again ?  \\nS: Es increíble que vuelvan a hacerlo.  \\nT: Very good. Es increíble que vuelvan a hacerlo . And how would you say it's incredible t hat they \\ndid it again ? It's incredible that they returned to do it :  \\nS: Es increíble que volvieron, volvieran, volvieran a hacerlo.  \\nT: Good. Es increíble que volvieran a hacerlo . Very good. Well done.\",\n",
       " \"Track 83  \\nT: What was the word for what or that?  \\nS: Que.  \\nT: Que. And what was the word for to buy ?  \\nS: Comprar .  \\nT: Comprar . Good. So if we wanted to say something like that you bought it is not my problem , that \\nyou might have bought it is not my problem , the fact that you bought it is not my pr oblem , we can \\njust start with que and put the verb in the mood tense, and we get this feeling. The fact that you \\nmay have bought it . We're doing the same thing in English - may have - with this may we are \\ngetting some mood. So, let's start. Speaking inform ally, that you bought it, that you may have \\nbought it :  \\nS: So comprar  becomes compraron , comprara , compraras .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Que compraras.  \\nT: Don't forget your it just because you're concentrating so much on the verb.  \\nS: Que lo compraras.  \\nT: Is not my p roblem :  \\nS: No es mi problema.  \\nT: Good. Que lo compraras no es mi problema . Maybe you want to say something like, that you \\ntold him is not my problem . So, to tell  we can use decir , to tell or to say, or contar  we saw as well. \\nContar  means to count or to recount . So let's use contar . That you told him , the fact that you told \\nhim, is not my problem . Speaking informally still:  \\nS: Que contaras. Que le contaras no es mi problema.  \\nT: Que le contaras no es mi problema.  Good. In English I should say - although I  have this London \\nEnglish so often I don't say - I should say if I were you . Now I was  is the normal past tense, fromto be . I was . So we change was to were  to get the past mood tense in English. If I were you , \\nhypothetical past. In Spanish whenever we spe ak about the past hypothetically, after si, after if, we \\nwill use the mood tense. So for example, what was the verb to be able to , can, related to power ?  \\nS: Poder .  \\nT: Poder . Now if you want to make the they form in the past, they could, they were able to , there's a \\nslight change. The pod that you would be left with after taking -er away from poder , turns to pud. \\nPud. So how would you say they were able to , using the point in the past?  \\nS: Pudieron .  \\nT: Pudieron . Good. So from this base we can form the moo d tense. So if you wanted to say something \\nlike if I could . If I could cook, I would cook . So, if I could :  \\nS: Si pudiera.  \\nT: To cook , or “to kitchen”:  \\nS: Cocinar .  \\nT: Good. Si pudiera cocinar , I would cook . So to find would , you must look back at I woul d like. It \\nwould please me :  \\nS: Me gustaría.  \\nT: Good. So, there you have your would . So I would cook :  \\nS: Cocinaría.  \\nT: Good. Si pudiera cocinar, cocinaría . How would you say if I could cancel it, I would ? So, if I \\ncould cancel it, I would cancel it :  \\nS: Si pudiera cancelarlo.  \\nT: I would . So I would cancel it :  \\nS: Lo cancelaría.  \\nT: Good. Si pudiera cancelarlo, lo cancelaría . Good. What was to have ? The to have  that we use to \\ngo into the past?S: Haber .  \\nT: Haber . Now when haber  goes into the point in the past, that first bit hab of haber , when you take \\noff your -er, it changes for the point in the past. It becomes hub, h-u-b. So how would you say they \\nhad using the point in the past, going from haber  and this hab of haber  will become hub when \\nwe mak e the point in the past:  \\nS: Hubieron .  \\nT: Hubieron . Good. So we can say, if you had told me it . So speaking informally, if you had told me \\nit, how would you say that? If you had told me it :  \\nS: Si me lo hubieras contado.  \\nT: Good. Si me lo hubieras contad o, I would have gone . So if you had told me, if you had told me it, \\nI would have gone . So now we need would have.  We leave everything else at the door. So how do \\nwe get would have  from haber ?  \\nS: Habería .  \\nT: Habría .  \\nS: Habría .  \\nT: Good. The e falls away. Habría . So I would have gone :  \\nS: Habría ido.  \\nT: Good. So al l together. If you had told me it, if you had told me it, I would have gone :  \\nS: Si me lo hubieras contado, habría ido.  \\nT: Good. Si me lo hubieras contado, habría ido . If we had known, w e would have gone, if we had \\nknown, we would have gone :  \\nS: Si hubiéramos sabido,  \\nT: We would have gone :  \\nS: Habríamos ido.T: Good. What is to see ?  \\nS: Ver.  \\nT: Ver. And what is they saw , point in the past?  \\nS: Vieron .  \\nT: Vieron . What was my house ?  \\nS: Mi casa.  \\nT: Mi casa . Your house , informally:  \\nS: Tu casa.  \\nT: Tu casa . Do you remember how to say his house, her house, your house (formally), their house ?  \\nS: Su casa.   \\nT: Su casa . Good. So how would you say if you saw their house ? If you saw t heir house :  \\nS: Si vieras su casa.  \\nT: Good. Si vieras su casa . How would you say if you saw it, you would understand it ? Let's speak \\nformally . If you saw it, you would understand it , speaking formally :  \\nS: Si lo viera, comprendía - comprenderí a.  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: Comprendía's  the past, is the tense, isn't it?  \\nT: The line in the past. Very good. Si lo viera, lo comprendería . Or we can use entender , which \\nalso means to understand. Si lo viera, lo entendería.  \\nI should mention that there also exists an alternative form for the past mood tense : the past \\nsubjunctive, with -ase or -iese. So you may hear hablase  instead of hablara , or entendiese  instead \\nof entendiera , comiese  instead of comiera , comiésemos  instead of comiéramos . But how much \\nthat alternative form is used really depends on the dialect. The main way, the most common way \\nof using the past subjunctive is the one that we've learned here. And there's no difference betweenthe two in meaning. They are just two versions of the same te nse. So you don't need to worry about \\nusing hablase  instead of hablara  for example, but you will need to recognize it if you hear it or \\nread it somewhere.\",\n",
       " 'Track 84  \\nT: So now we really do have the panorama of all times and moods in Spanish. So now that\\'s \\neverything. That\\'s every tense including both the idea of time and the idea of mood. We\\'ve learned \\nhow to construct them all, and we should really listen actively to refresh any knowledge that we \\nmight need to refresh through our exposure to Spanish. Analy zing always what we hear, and if \\nyou\\'re listening to a song or a movie maybe you just hear the endings of the verbs at the beginning. \\nBut if you can identify what that ending means, that\\'s the important bit. In the same way this course \\nhas been focused equ ally on the process that we go through in building our structures in Spanish, \\nas it has been focused on content. So half of the point of this course has been content, has been \\nteaching you Spanish; and the other half has been how to manage Spanish, how to manage these \\nelements that we\\'ve learned. How to think about this information and how to relate to information \\ngenerally in a new way. How to find things that you think you might have forgotten. We\\'ve also \\nlooked now and then at some irregularities in Span ish. Verbs or other words that don\\'t follow the \\nrules that we learned. Now the older the language, the more irregularities it tends to have. Spanish, \\neffectively being modern Latin, is quite prone to irregularities. But the irregularities can be made \\nsense  of within themselves. You can group together irregularities. So whilst throughout the course \\nwe were looking at the odd irregularity as it popped up, now at the end of the course we are going \\nto tidy up the irregular verbs. So there are a group of verbs, which we can call the “ go verbs\". \\nThese are the verbs that use -go instead of -o for the I form. For example, how do you say to have, \\nto have,  for possession?  \\nS: Tener .  \\nT: Tener . And I have :  \\nS: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo . So this -go pops up for the I version, bu t only for the I version. How do you say he has , or \\nshe has, you (formal) have ?  \\nS: Tiene .  \\nT: Tiene . And you (informal):S: Tienes .  \\nT: And they:  \\nS: Tienen .  \\nT: Tienen . And we:  \\nS: Tenemos .  \\nT: Tenemos . So the -go is only popping up for the I version.  What was to come ?  \\nS: Venir .  \\nT: Venir . Good. I come :  \\nS: Vengo .  \\nT: Vengo . So here we have the -go again. But he comes :  \\nS: Viene .  \\nT: Viene . They come :  \\nS: Vienen .  \\nT: You (informal):  \\nS: Vienes .  \\nT: We:  \\nS: Venemos - venimos.  \\nT: Venimos . Good. So we have this -go popping up just for the I form. We\\'ve seen other verbs like \\nthis. What was to go out or to leave ?  \\nS: Salir .  \\nT: Salir . And I go out or I leave :  \\nS: Salgo .  \\nT: Salgo . To put :S: Poner .  \\nT: Poner . And I put :  \\nS: Pongo .  \\nT: Pongo . Good. We h ave decir , to say  or to tell and we get digo, which is even more irregular but \\nwe see the -go. We have hacer , to make or to do , and we get hago . Oír, which means to hear , oír. \\nAnd we have oigo, I hear . Traer, traer  means to bring . And I bring  is traigo . So, to bring is t-r-\\na-e-r, traer , and then I is traigo . It takes an extra i. So here we get traigo . Traer  is interesting \\nbecause traer  means to bring . But when it forms part of another verb, we can translate it like -tract . \\nFor example, extraer  means:  \\nS: Extract .  \\nT: Good. How would you say attract ?  \\nS: Atraer .  \\nT: Atraer . Contract :  \\nS: Contraer .  \\nT: Distract :  \\nS: Distraer .  \\nT: Good. I distract :  \\nS: Distraigo .  \\nT: Distraigo . I distract . Or you could say  I get distracted . Me distraigo . Good. So these -go verbs \\nare a little bit special and they behave quite irregularly. But more or less in the same way. One of \\nthe things they do in the same way is that in the mood tense, instead of switching vowels like the \\nrest of the verbs do in the mood tense in the presen t, they go from -go to -ga. So whilst in the \\nnormal present this -go only pops up for I, we have tengo /tiene /tienes /tienen /tenemos , the -ga for \\nthe mood sense is for everybody. So we get tenga  for I, he/she/it and you formal. How would you \\nmake it informa l?  \\nS: Tengas .T: Exactly. So if you were to say I want you to come, I want that you come , speaking informally - so \\nI want that :  \\nS: Quiero que.  \\nT: Good. Now we want  you come and we want the mood tense version. So it\\'s a -go verb, so our base \\nfor the mo od tense is venga . So if you want to speak informally and say I want that you come, I \\nwant you to come :  \\nS: Quiero que vengas.  \\nT: Very good. Quiero que vengas . And you will hear actually in Spain venga, venga, venga . They \\nuse it all the time, meaning come  on, come on . Venga vale . They say vale as well in Spain. Venga \\nvale.  You will hear this all the time. When a Spanish person is hanging up the telephone you can \\nhear fifteen of them, venga vale , vale venga , venga vale . So this venga  that you will hear arou nd \\na lot will be a nice hook to remember that this -go goes to -ga. Actually, when somebody is \\nanswering the phone in Spain, you might hear diga or dígame . What does that mean, dígame ?  \\nS: Tell me .  \\nT: Yes. The mood tense by itself is an orde r. For a positive order then we have the me after the verb, \\ndígame . So you will hear people answering the phone like this in Spain. Tell me . Dígame . So \\ntraer  was to bring . What is I bring ?  \\nS: Traigo .  \\nT: Traigo . And what is you brin g, speaking informally ?  \\nS: Traigas .  \\nT: This is the mood tense. But we don\\'t want the mood tense, we just want you bring  informally.  \\nS: Traes .  \\nT: Traes . Good. But if you say I want you to bring it , how would you say that? I want you to bring \\nit, infor mally:  \\nS: Quiero que lo traigas.T: Very good. Quiero que lo traigas . I don\\'t want you to distract me,  I don\\'t want you to distract me, \\nstill informal:  \\nS: No quiero que me distraigas.  \\nT: Very good . No quiero que me distraigas . I don\\'t want you to distr act me . Very good.',\n",
       " \"Track 85  \\nT: We can identify this group of -go verbs and expect them to go to -ga when they are in the \\nsubjunctive or the mood tense. So I leave  from salir  is:  \\nS: Salgo .  \\nT: Salgo . And if I want to tell somebody leave  (formally):  \\nS: Salga .  \\nT: Salga . And if I want to tell more than one person:  \\nS: Salgan .  \\nT: Good, and if I want to tell them don't leave :  \\nS: No salgan ?  \\nT: No salgan . Good. Poner  was to put . I put:  \\nS: Pongo .  \\nT: Pongo , good. Lets speak formally, put it here, pu t it here :  \\nS: Lo ponga aquí .  \\nT: And where does that lo go with positive commands?  \\nS: Póngalo aquí.  \\nT: Good. Póngalo aquí. But don't put it here :  \\nS: No lo ponga aquí.  \\nT: Very good. No lo ponga aquí. We saw with regu lar verbs that we have a shortcut where we don't \\nuse the mood tense for informal positive commands. So if I want to tell you to eat I can just say \\ncome , I go to comes  and I drop the s, come . If I want to tell you to find it I can go to encontrar , \\nencuen tras, I can drop the s, encuéntralo . That’s our shortcut for informal positive commands \\nwhere we don't use the mood tense. With these -go verbs, to make that shortcut you just drop the \\n-go, so for example, how do you say I have from tener ?S: Tengo .  \\nT: Tengo . If you want to tell somebody informally have , you just drop the -go:  \\nS: Ten.  \\nT: Ten. Have it:   \\nS: Tenlo .  \\nT: Yes. Tenlo .  \\nS: So we don't see tenga ?  \\nT: For formal, but we are now looking at the shortcut that we have for informal, s o how would you \\nsay have it , speaking formally ?  \\nS: Téngalo .  \\nT: Téngalo . But informally we are not using the mood tense, we have a short cut, it's just different to \\nthe short cut we learnt before, the short cut is just dropping the -go, tenlo. A nice way to remember \\nthis is how you will see people in many Spanish speaking countries answering the phone, either \\ndígame , formally, or dime  informally. What is I come ?  \\nS: Vengo .  \\nT: And how do you tell somebody formally to come?  \\nS: Venga .  \\nT: Venga . Now how would you make it informal?  \\nS: Ven.  \\nT: Ven. Good. So I should mention that the venga  that you hear in Spain as come on  is not necessarily \\nformal, it’s lost that feeling of formality because its like a fixed expression, so venga , veng a you \\nhear all the time, and then ven will sound much more like come,  physically come,  rather than come \\non; venga , venga , venga is used like come on . What was to leave or to go out ?  \\nS: Salir .T: Salir . I leave or I go out :  \\nS: Salgo .  \\nT: Salgo . Leave , speaking informally:  \\nS: Sal.  \\nT: Sal. We can just drop the -go. I say or I tell is digo. If you want to say tell me formally , how is it?  \\nS: Dígame .  \\nT: Dígame . If you want to make that same command informally , how will it be?  \\nS: Dime .  \\nT: Dime . Good. So both things you hear when people answer the phone in Spain - dime , dígame  - \\nand in other countries, in other Spanish speaking countries as well. So for -go verbs they will go \\nto -ga to form the mood tense and for the orders , the short  cut for the informal positive order they \\nwill just drop this -go. So if you want to say tell me when you come , speaking informally, how \\nwould that be?  \\nS: Dime cuando vengas.  \\nT: Good. After cuando  we are using the mood tense because we are referring to t he future. Dime \\ncuando vengas . Tell me when you come . How would you say tell me when you do it  - and lets \\nspeak formally now ? Tell me when you do it , speaking formally:  \\nS: Dígame cuando lo haga.  \\nT: Very good. Dígame cuando lo haga . Good.\",\n",
       " 'Track 86  \\nT: These -go verbs, these verbs that take -go instead of -o for the I version in the present, also behave \\na little bit strangely in the future tenses. In the will and would  tenses. So, we can look at that now, \\nand whilst looking at it, re vise the endings that we learned for will and would . So we said that our \\nwill endings, what we add on to the to form of the verb to get will, are the same as those very \\nirregular versions of haber  in the present. So we can make that connection to help us i nternalize \\nthem. Can you talk me through those will endings?  \\nS: So it’s -e for I and -emos  for us.  \\nT: For we, very good.  \\nS: For we. -a for he, she, it, and you formal , -an for they.  \\nT: They  or you plural, and the last one, you informal?  \\nS: -as.  \\nT: Go od. So we have the endings. And our endings for would , which again we are adding on to the \\nto form of the verb, we need to remember one key sound for would . If we remember how to say I \\nwould like , that’s a nice hook to remember the key sound. So what is th e key sound?  \\nS: -ía.  \\nT: -ía. And then on to -ia we can add on, of course, our -mos or -n or -s if we need to. Good. So -go \\nverbs, these verbs that have -go and then -ga for the mood tense, when they are building the futures, \\nthey have a contraction. But , they all make the same contraction. For example, I will have is \\ntendré . Tendré .  \\nS: Tendré .  \\nT: Tendré . So, of course, it should be “teneré”, but it’s tendré . So that last e of tener  turns into a d, \\nand we get tendré . This is a contraction because it mea ns we end up with two syllables instead  of \\nthree. It would be “teneré”, but it’s tendré . Which just makes everything a little bit more efficient. \\nBut all of these verbs, these -go verbs, are behaving in a similar way. So we have to come :  \\nS: Venir .T: Venir. And I will come :  \\nS: Vendré .  \\nT: Vendré . Very good. I would come - the same contraction for both futures:  \\nS: Vendría .  \\nT: Vendría . Good. I would come. We would come :  \\nS: Vendríamos .  \\nT: Vendríamos . We would come later, but we don’t have time. We would  come later, but we don’t \\nhave time :  \\nS: Vendríamos  más tarde , pero no tenemos tiempo .  \\nT: Good. Vendríamos más tarde , pero no tenemos tiempo . What was to put ?  \\nS: Poner .  \\nT: And I put :  \\nS: Pongo .  \\nT: Pongo . So this -go alerts us to the fact that this ve rb will behave in this irregular way as well. So \\nif you want to say I will put it here , how will it be? I will put it here :  \\nS: Lo pondré aquí .  \\nT: Good. Lo pondré aquí . I would put it here, I would put it here :  \\nS: Lo pondría aquí.  \\nT: Good. We would put it here :  \\nS: Lo pondríamos aquí.  \\nT: Good. Lo pondríamos aquí.  And we will put it here :  \\nS: Lo pondremos aquí.  \\nT: Good. Lo pondremos aquí . What was to leave or to go out ?S: Salir .  \\nT: Salir . I leave or I go out :  \\nS: Salgo .  \\nT: Salgo. So again this -go can set off our little alarm bell that this verb will probably be irregular in \\nthe futures. So how would you say I would leave or I would go out ?  \\nS: Saldría .  \\nT: Saldría . Good. You would leave or you would go out  (informally):  \\nS: Saldrías .  \\nT: Saldrías . Will you leave? Will you go out tonight? Will you go out tonight? :  \\nS: ¿Saldrías esta noche?  \\nT: That’s would you , now we want will you :  \\nS: ¿Saldrás esta noche?  \\nT: Good. ¿Saldrás esta noche ? But of course we have esta noche which  is future context so we could \\njust use the present. We could just say You go out tonight?  We don’t need the future, so how would \\nthat be?  \\nS: ¿Sales esta noche?  \\nT: ¿Sales esta noche ? Good. So for most -go verbs, we take off the -go and we put -dré for I will \\nand -dría for I would , in most of them. Traer , to bring, doesn’t do it. Traeré , I will bring . Atraeré , \\nI will attract . Distraeré , I will distract . But most of these that have -go will go to -dría or -dré. \\nHacer  and decir , to do or to make or to say or to tell , hacer  and decir  are particularly irregular. \\nAnd we’ve already seen this. We’ve seen how after haber  they become hecho  and dicho . It’s very \\nirregular. We saw how the informal command from hacer  is haz, h-a-z. Again irregular, and here \\nas well. I will do is haré . So it’s not following this rule. It’s even more irregular. We have haré . \\nHaré . I will do or I will make .  \\nS: Haré .T: H-a-r-e. Haré . And all we need to do is identify one of these irregularities and then we understand \\nthat all  of will and all of would  will use this same base, the same base that haré  has used.  \\nSo we will do or we will make is:  \\nS: Haremos .  \\nT: Good. And we would do or we would make :  \\nS: Haríamos .  \\nT: Haríamos . We would do it, but we’re busy now. We would  do it, but we’re busy now : S: \\nLo haríamos , pero estamos -  \\nT: Occupied .  \\nS: Ocupados ahora.  \\nT: Good. Lo haríamos , pero estamos ocupados ahora . We would do it, but we’re busy now . So \\nharíamos  is we would do or we would make , and what is we will do or we wi ll make ?  \\nS: Haremos .  \\nT: Haremos . And they will do, they will make :  \\nS: Harán .  \\nT: Harán . I would say or I would tell is diría . So we get from decir , diría . I would say , he would say , \\nshe would say , you (formal) would say :  \\nS: Diría .  \\nT: So like I said,  we just need one of these versions to understand how the rest will be. So if diría  is \\nI would say or I would tell , how is I will say or I will tell ?  \\nS: Diré.  \\nT: Diré. I will tell you later  (speaking informally):  \\nS: Te diré más tarde .T: Good. Te diré más tarde . And of course, having future context with más tarde , we could just \\nsay:  \\nS: Te digo más tarde .  \\nT: Good. Te digo más tarde . I tell you later.  What was to be able to ?  \\nS: Poder .  \\nT: Poder . How do you say I would be able to or I could ?  \\nS: Podría .  \\nT: Podría . Good. The /e/ falls out. So this is a different irregularity. This is not a -go verb. Podría . \\nOf course it was “podería”, but many years of “podería, podería, podería,  podería”, the /e/ fell \\naway. Podría . How is to put ?  \\nS: Poner.  \\nT: Poner . And I would put :  \\nS: Pondría .  \\nT: Pondría . Good. So there’s a subtle difference in sound between I would be able to , podría , and I \\nwould put , pondría . We would be able to :  \\nS: Pondríamos .  \\nT: We would be able to . That’s we would put .  \\nS: Podríamos .  \\nT: Podríamos . And we would put :  \\nS: Pondríamos .  \\nT: Pondríamos .',\n",
       " 'Track 87  \\nT: Looking at the past tenses, the line in the past and the dot in the past, the line in the past is extremely \\nregular. We only have a few odd irregular verbs for the l ine in the past. Ser is one of them and we \\ncan remember by thinking of an era. So what is the base for ser as a line in the past?  \\nS: Era.  \\nT: Era. Good. So this means I was , you (formal) were , he/she/it was , as a line in the past. How would \\nyou say we were ?  \\nS: Éramos .  \\nT: Éramos . Good. The accent doesn’t move. Éramos . They were or you guys were :  \\nS: Eran .  \\nT: Eran . And you informal?  \\nS: Eras .  \\nT: Eras . Good. We had the line in the past of ir, which was a little bit like a mix between the -aba \\nending  that we have for -ar verbs for the line in the past and the -ía ending that we have for -er/-ir \\nverbs in the line in past. So what was I was going from ir?  \\nS: Iba.  \\nT: Very good. Iba. We were going :  \\nS: Íbamos .  \\nT: You informal:  \\nS: Ibas.  \\nT: And they or you guys :  \\nS: Iban .  \\nT: Iban . Good. And then we had ver, to see . How is I see, in the present ?  \\nS: Veo.T: Veo. And this extra e that it keeps for the I form in the present, veo, carries over into the line in the \\npast. So I was seeing, you  (formal) were seeing, he/she/it were seeing  is veía.  \\nS: Veía .  \\nT: Veía . So we were seeing :  \\nS: Veíamos .  \\nT: You informal:  \\nS: Veías .  \\nT: And they:  \\nS: Veían .  \\nT: Good. So the line in the past is a very safe tense. We just have a few irregular verbs, but for the \\nrest we can be very certain that taking off the -ar and putting -aba, or taking off the -er/-ir and \\nputting -ía is going to give us the result that we want. The point in the past is less regular, less \\nreliable. There are a group of verbs in the dot of the po int in the past which are irregular, but they \\nall do something very similar. Now most of the verbs in this group are -go verbs, but not all of \\nthem. Now what these verbs do in the point in the past is that firstly, the beginning bit of the verb \\n- so for ex ample, if we have poder  - that beginning bit, pod-, changes and we already saw this. \\nWe saw, for example, they were able was pudieron . So that pod- changes to pud-. Here it’s a little \\nchange, but there are more drastic changes with other verbs. So this is the first thing. The base of \\nthe verb that is left once we take the endings off changes. Sometimes radically, sometimes a little \\nbit like here from pod- to pud-. The second thing that they do is that they use a mixture of the point \\nendings from -ar verbs and from -er/-ir verbs. They use a mixture of the two endings from both \\nsides, but always the same mixture for each of these irregular verbs. And the third thing they do is \\nto not have the accent on the endings. So firstly, let’s revise the point in th e past with hablar  and \\ncomer . Just to refresh what are these endings. So we have hablar  to speak , and I spoke is:  \\nS: Hablé .  \\nT: Good. And he spoke or she spoke  or you (formal) spoke :  \\nS: Habló .T: Habló . And then we had to eat  which was comer . And I ate:  \\nS: Comí .  \\nT: Comí . And he ate or she ate or you (formal) ate, it ate - habló  and then with comer  it’s:  \\nS: Comió .  \\nT: Comió . Good. Back to hablar . How was we spoke ?  \\nS: Hablamos .  \\nT: Hablamos . Good. Same as the present tense. And they spoke :  \\nS: Hablar on.  \\nT: Hablaron . And you (informal) spoke  - which in the you (informal) version, we hear that informal \\ns and the informal t in the ending:  \\nS: Hablaste .  \\nT: Hablaste . Good. Back to comer . How is we ate ?  \\nS: Comemos . Comimos .  \\nT: Comimos . They ate or you guys ate :  \\nS: Comieron .  \\nT: Comieron . And you (informal) ate:  \\nS: Comiste .  \\nT: Very good. Comiste . So that’s the panorama of our dot in the past, but these irregular verbs use a \\nmixture of these two groups for different endings in the point in the past. F or example, tener , to \\nhave . In the point in the past, the way that ten- changes, that root changes, we said that’s the first \\nthing that happens. The ten- of tener  becomes tuv-. T-u-v.  \\nS: Tuv-.T: And I had is tuve. And he/she/it had is tuvo . So we ar e not accenting the endings. Tuve . Tuvo . \\nSo where are these two endings coming from, -e and -o? Are they coming from the -ar verbs or \\nfrom the -er/-ir verbs?  \\nS: -ar.  \\nT: Good. So we have tuve and tuvo . So these two endings for I and for he/she/it/you form al come \\nfrom -ar and the rest come from -er/-ir. So how would you say we had with the point in the past?  \\nS: Tuvimos .  \\nT: Tuvimos . And you (informal):  \\nS: Tuviste .  \\nT: Tuviste . And they:  \\nS: Tuvieron .  \\nT: Tuvieron . Good. So now that we have worked our way through this one verb, all we need to do \\nfor the other ones is to find the base. The irregular base for the verb and then we know what to do \\nwith it. What was to be , for states?  \\nS: Estar .  \\nT: Estar . Now I was , the point in the past, from estar  is estuve . So it’s nice to look at tener  and estar  \\ntogether because we have tuve for I had  and estuve  for I was .  \\nS: Estuve .  \\nT: And I wasn’t :  \\nS: No estuve.  \\nT: Good. He was, she was, you were (formal):  \\nS: Estuvo .  \\nT: Good. We were :  \\nS: Estuvimos .T: Estuvimos . You were  (informally):  \\nS: Estuviste .  \\nT: Estuviste . Where were you? :  \\nS: ¿Dónde estuviste ?  \\nT: ¿Dónde estuviste ? They were, you guys were :  \\nS: Estuvieron .  \\nT: Estuvieron . Where were you guys? :  \\nS: ¿Dónde estuvieron ?  \\nT: Good. ¿ Dónde estuvieron ? So whil st we have these irregular forms, which need a little bit more \\neffort, many times you can just use the line in the past instead. So if you say something like ¿dónde \\nestuviste?  - where were you?  - and here we’re using a point in time, so maybe it sounds lik e where \\nwere you in this precise moment when we needed you ?, but even so we could still just use the line \\nin the past to get around this irregular tense. Now we don’t want to avoid it forever. Anything that \\nwe don’t control, of the line which will end up controlling us. Anything we are uncertain of that \\nwe don’t take the control of, will control us. But, many times you’re in a conversation and you \\ndon’t have time to find that irregular form and maybe you want to worry about it later  and check \\nor think abo ut what it was. In that case, you can just turn to the line in the past. ¿Dónde estabas? \\ninstead of ¿dónde estuviste? So how would you say I had to go using this point in the past? So \\nhow is I had , using the point in the past?  \\nS: Tuve .  \\nT: Good. So I had to go :  \\nS: Tuve que ir.  \\nT: Good. So tuve que ir , you would want to use it if you meant that in one precise moment you know \\nsomething happened and I had to go: tuve que ir . But, you could also use the line in the past and \\nnot have any problem there if you wanted to avoid this irregular tense just to get the meaningacross. So you can just say tenía que ir , which is regular, to avoid using this irregular tense. What \\nwas to say or to tell ?  \\nS: Decir .  \\nT: Decir  or contar , but decir  we are working with for now. So dec- becomes dij- in the point in the \\npast. Dij-. D-i-j. What is I said ?  \\nS: Dije.  \\nT: Dije. He said :  \\nS: Dijo.  \\nT: Good. We said :  \\nS: Dijimos .  \\nT: Dijimos . Good. So they’re using the same endings, this group of irregular verbs. -e and -o from \\nthe -ar group and then the rest of the endings from the -er/-ir group for the point in the past.',\n",

Now if you want to say I put , the po int in the past, I put  in the past of course in \\nEnglish it doesn’t change. I put . Present. I put. Past. I put  for the past, our base is pus-, pus-. P-u-\\ns.  \\nSo how would you say I put ?  \\nS: Pusé .  \\nT: Puse .  \\nS: Ah, puse .  \\nT: The endings don’t take the acce nt here for these irregular verbs. Puse . You put , informally:  \\nS: Pusiste .  \\nT: Where did you put it? :  \\nS: ¿Dónde lo pusiste ?  \\nT: ¿Dónde lo pusiste ? Good. And now we can see where that poner  -pose was coming from. We \\nsaid that when we have poner  as part of a verb in Spanish, it’s -pose in English. Componer , \\ncompose . Exponer , expose . Oponer , oppose . And now we hear this -pose sound coming out in \\nthe dot in the past: puse , pusiste . What was to do or to make ?  \\nS: Hacer .  \\nT: The base here in this point in the past is hic-. H-i-c. So if you want to say I made or I did :  \\nS: Hice .  \\nT: And he made or he did :S: Hizo .  \\nT: Hizo . Here it would be h-i-z-o. We can’t keep the c, because it would spell “hico”. Hizo . They \\nmade or you guys made :  \\nS: Hicieron .  \\nT: Good. Wh enever you identify one of these irregular verbs in the point in the past where the base \\nof the verb has changed, then you know what to do with it. That end -o is coming from -ar and \\nthen you have -imos , -iste, ieron  from -er/-ir. Sometimes the change is s ubtle. We saw that pod- \\nof poder  became pud-. We saw in another lesson that hab- of haber  became hub-. Ven- of venir , \\nbecomes vin-. So how would you say I came ?  \\nS: Vine .  \\nT: And he came :  \\nS: Vino .  \\nT: You know how to say wine in Spanish?  \\nS: Vino .  \\nT: He came with wine :  \\nS: Vino con vino.  \\nT: Vino con vino . Traer , to bring has traje , I brought in the past. So how would you say he brought ?  \\nS: Trajo .  \\nT: Good. We brought :  \\nS: Trajimos .  \\nT: Trajimos . And I brought again:  \\nS: Traje .  \\nT: And traje  also means suit like the kind you wear. And it’s masculine. So I brought a suit would \\nbe:S: Traje un traje.  \\nT: Traje un traje. Vino con vino. Traje un traje . There’s one extra irregular past point to look at. \\nIt’s extra irregular because it doesn’t rea lly follow these rules about what groups it’s taking the \\nsounds from , and it’s also extra irregular because it is the past for both ser and ir. It is the past for \\nboth I was and I went . And this is fui. F-u-i. Fui.  \\nS: Fui.  \\nT: Fui. So fui means I was from ser, point in the past, and it also means I went . So ser and ir in the \\npoint in the past, they share a past. Fui means I was or I went . And fue means he was, she was, it \\nwas, you were or went. So we see that it’s extremely irregular. Fui. I was or I went . How would \\nyou say I didn’t go ?  \\nS: No fui.  \\nT: No fui.  Fue, he was  or he went . How would you say he didn’t go ?  \\nS: No fue.  \\nT: No fue . How would you say we went ?  \\nS: Fuimos .  \\nT: Good. And you (informal):  \\nS: Fuiste .  \\nT: Fuiste . Now to make they or you (plural) was or went, we would add on -ieron , but we will find it \\nvery difficult to pronounce “fuieron”, “fuieron”. So the / i/ sound, the i fell away. So how would \\nthat sound?  \\nS: Fueron .  \\nT: Fueron . So the i, the / i/ sound, falls away. Fueron . The sam e thing happens in a couple of other \\ncases too. We have trajeron  from traer , to bring . They brought , you guys brought , trajeron . \\nDijeron , they or you guys said . So a couple of other examples there of that i falling away, just for \\nsound reasons. “Trajieron” , “dijieron” is kind of difficult to say so it fell away for efficiency: \\ndijeron , trajeron , fueron . So now that we have fueron , we can make the past mood tense. Wecan say something like if I were you because we always go from the they form of the point in  the \\npast. So if they went or they were is fueron , we can say if I were you and of course we’re using the \\nmood tense here because we have if going into the past hypothetically. So this is a mood tense that \\nis quite specific for the past. We are not putting  the mood tense after si, after if in the present. But \\nfor this hypothetical past, if I were you , there we have it in English as well as in Spanish. We said \\nthat if I were you instead of “if I was you” is mood tense in English. So how would that be? If I \\nwere you :  \\nS: Fueron  becomes fueran .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: And the I version is fuera .  \\nT: Good.  \\nS: “Si fuera ti”.  \\nT: Now it’s just the word for you.  \\nS: Tú.  \\nT: Tú or usted  depending on who we’re talking to. So si yo fuera tú . Si fuera tú or si yo fuera tú , \\nsi yo fuera usted , if I were you . Now we are understanding why we went from the they version to \\nfind the mood tense in the past. Because going from the they version instead of the to form means \\nthat if there is some irregularity, we will transfer that irregu larity over into the mood tense. So we \\nwent from fueron  to fuera  and we will go from, for example, dijeron , they spoke , to dijera  so we \\ncarry over that irregularity of having lost that i. Trajeron , they brought and then trajera  for the \\nmood tense. I had was tuve. What was they had or you guys had ?  \\nS: Tuvieron .  \\nT: Tuvieron . So now we can say if I had it, I would tell you. If I had it, I would tell you :  \\nS: Si lo tuviera .T: I would tell you.  You can use contar . Decir  is very irregular for would . So if you don’t want to \\ndeal with that now,  imagine you’re in a real life context, you can just go to the more regular verb, \\nwhich is contar . I would tell you , informally:  \\nS: Te contaría .  \\nT: Good. Si lo tuviera , te contaría , or te lo contaría . I would tell you it . We like to close with this it \\nin Spanish a lot. Si lo tuvieria , te lo contaría , I would tell you it . So we have to do or to make \\nwhich is hacer , and we said that the root for the point in the past is hic-. H-i-c for the I version. So \\nhow woul d you say I made or I did ?  \\nS: Hice .  \\nT: Hice . And they did or they made :  \\nS: Hicieron .  \\nT: Hicieron . Good. So you could say I wanted for them to do it. I wanted that they did it :  \\nS: Quería que lo hicieran.  \\nT: Good. I wanted them to do it. I wanted tha t they do it . Quería que lo hicieran . How would you \\nsay I wanted for us to do it, I wanted that we do it, that we did it ?  \\nS: Quería que lo hiciéramos.  \\nT: Good. Well done. Quería que lo hiciéramos . Good. I’m not as interested here in installing, let’s \\nsay, all of this content, all of these irregular verbs. All I want to give you is an exposure to how \\nthey might work. The irregular verbs that you can come across, so that practicing, you can manage \\nthem. So you should not be afraid of making mistakes. You should build the verbs how you are \\nused to and if you suspect that this one might be irregular, check. Check with the person that you \\nare speaking to.',\n",
       " 'Track 89  \\nT: So in the spirit of looking at irregularities in Spanish and how to deal with them and how to identify \\nthem, I wanted to spend a little bit of time speaking about making your own rules. We’ve taught \\nyou a great amount of Spanish for you to be very conversational and reach fluency just through \\npractice and listening in a very short amount of time , if you get practicing. But we haven’t looked \\nat every single piece of content of Spanish, of course, but the content that we’ve looked at has \\ntaken from every area of the language in an analytical way which will allow you to make your own \\nrules when you come across things that you don’t quite understand whilst you’re practicing and \\nexposing yourself to Spanish. So I just want to experiment a little bit in regards to that with you \\nnow. So I will present you with some imaginary situations where you see the language behaving \\nin certain ways and I want you to make your own rule. Now it doesn’t mean it’s necessarily your \\nown. Somebody else might have come up with it before, but that you will figure out for yourself \\nwhat is going on. So for example, the word for  too, as in t-o-o is demasiado .  \\nDemasiado .  \\nS: Demasiado .  \\nT: It is a bit of a long word, but if you break it up it’s easier to digest. You have de más, of more , -iado. \\nAnd this is too, t-o-o, as in too many. Actually de más  can be used by itself if y ou say tengo \\ncuatro de más . I have four of more , tengo cuatro de más . It means I have four too many . I have \\nfour spare. I have four extra . So demasiado  means too. Now imagine you hear these following \\nsentences and I want you to work out what’s happening he re. Why this word is behaving differently \\nin different circumstances. So you might hear demasiadas casas . You might hear demasiados \\ncoches . And you might hear demasiado agresivo , demasiado agresiva , and demasiado \\nagresivos . Again. You might hear demasiadas  casas , demasiados coches . Here it’s changing \\nfrom the base form demasiado . Demasiadas casas. Demasiados coches. And then here it’s not. \\nDemasiado agresivo. Demasiado agresiva. Demasiado agresivos.  So why in one situation is it \\nchanging and why in the othe r situation is it not?  \\nS: The only difference I see is that it’s related to nouns in the first two examples and in the second \\ntwo it’s related to something descriptive.T: Adjectives.  \\nS: Adjectives.  \\nT: Espectacular . Well done. Brilliant. That’s it. We said that identifying what type of word we have \\nwill mostly be all we need to do to figure out what’s going on. So we understand from this that \\nwhen demasiado  goes with a noun, it will change to match it: demasiadas casas , demasiados \\ncoches . But when it go es with an adjective it won’t: demasiado agresivo , demasiado agresiva , \\ndemasiado agresivos , demasiado agresivas . It’s not changing. So we didn’t learn that here, but \\nwe have been analytical enough of the language for you to figure that out by yourself. So another \\nexample for you to figure out what’s going on. Now the words ala, wing , agua , water  and aula, \\nhole or classroom  are all feminine words, but we say el ala , the wing . El agua , the water . And el \\naula, the classroom . What’s going on?  \\nS: Is it because the first letter of those words is a, and it would be weird to say “la ala”.  \\nT: You have other words that begin with a where you have la at the beginning, for example la \\nalfombra , the carpet . La almohada , the pillow . So you need to find something that’s d ifferent \\nbetween la almohada and la alfombra to el agua , el ala , el aula .  \\nS: Well, the difference in this case is that it’s just two, just two syllables, perhaps.  \\nT: That’s it. There are two syllables and they begin and end in a. So it’s a very specifi c thing. It’s not \\nsomething that we are really going to spend time on learning here in this course. Because it’s very \\nlikely as well that you’ll forget it. So what we have done throughout this course is given you the \\nanalytical skills to work it  out by yourself and the confidence to make your own rules. So that’s \\nthe rule. They are all feminine words, but they take el becuase they are two syllables and they \\nbegin and end with a. And we know that they are feminine because we say el agua fria . The cold \\nwater . Fria, not frio. So we know they are actually feminine even though they are taking el. One \\nmore exercise like this. The word for one is uno. The word for some  is alguno . And the word for \\nnone  is ninguno . So we have uno, alguno , ninguno . One, some , none . So if I tell you how many \\ndo you want , you will reply to me uno. Or if you don’t want any, ninguno . But if I say one man , \\nhow do I say one man or a man ?  \\nS: Un hombre.T: Un hombre . And if I say some man , I say algun hombre . And if I sa y no man , I say ningun \\nhombre . So we have uno, alguno  and ninguno . No quiero ninguno, quiero uno, quiero alguno . \\nBut, if I say I want one car , for example. Quiero un coche. Quiero algun coche. No quiero \\nningun coche . So what’s happening there? Why does uno become un and why does alguno  \\nbecome algun ?  \\nS: Because a noun is following.  \\nT: Yes, because we have a noun following it and it loses that last o. So uno, alguno , ninguno , become \\nun, algun , ningun . And you would notice that it doesn’t happen with the  feminine. So we have \\nuna mujer , a woman . Alguna mujer , some woman . Ninguna mujer , no woman . So the point is \\njust this, that we need to analyze the language that we are coming across, trying to pick out \\nanything that we don’t understand to tackle it so tha t we control it and we understand what’s \\nhappening so that that element of the language doesn’t control us. Very quickly, thinking in this \\nway you will get over your technical problems in the language. You will solve your technical \\nproblems and then when y ou solve your technical problems in a specific language, then you can \\nstart to live freely in that language. And become somebody else in that language that is also you, \\nbut somebody else, because you are using this mechanism or this tool which as we’ve said a few \\ntimes, permits and obliges you to perceive and express the world in a certain way. But before we \\ncan fully take advantage of that, we want to get over our technical difficulties and this is achieved \\nnot through memorizing what is correc t, but analyzing and understanding what is correct and \\nfinding why.',\n",
       " 'Track 90  \\nT: There are also some variations that you might come across in dialect. For example, in most of \\nSpain they use le and les whenever they’re referring to him or her, or you (formal), or you guys , or \\nthey. So instead of lo and la and los and las, they are using le and les, not just to make to him, to \\nher, they will use it always when they’re referring to people and not things. So in most of Spain, \\nle veo means I see him or her or you (formal). And lo veo means I see it . But in the great majority \\nof the Spanish speaking world this isn’t the case.  \\nIn most of Spain, you have vosotros , which is the you (plural informal), which is only used in \\nSpain or most of Spain. But again, now here in Latin America so that might be something you want \\nto listen out for if you will practice this dialect of Spanish. Many accents have an aspirated s in \\nSpanish so you might hear / ehtá/ instead está. /cómo ehtá / instead  of cómo está . /ehpero / instead \\nof espero .  \\nAround the Río de la Plata, for example, around Montevideo and Buenos Aires and in 30% of the \\nSpanish speaking world, used exclusively or mixed with tú, you also have vos. Vos. Another word \\nfor tú. And the verb conjugations might change  slightly. So instead of puedes  you might hear \\npodés . And because the accent’s coming on the end, that o isn’t splitting. Podés . Instead of \\nquieres , querés .  \\nSo you might come across small differences in different dialects of Spanish, but they are minor \\nand you now have all of the know -how and experience to identify and understand them. And if \\nyou want, adopt them, you can adopt these differences. It’s advisable to speak like the people you \\nare practicing with , because the more you speak like the Span ish that you are hearing, the more \\nyou understand. Now if you’re talking with people from different Spanish speaking countries, \\npeople with different dialects or accents in Spanish, then you might get something like a pan -\\nhispanic accent, let’s say, like m any native Spanish speakers who move around the Spanish \\nspeaking world or spend time with Spanish speakers from different countries also have. You might \\neven find yourself switching between different accents when you are talking with people from \\ndifferent places. Again a phenomenon that we also find occurring amongst native speakers.  \\nAhora hablamos español. Ahora somos hispanohablantes . Now we speak Spanish. Now we are \\nSpanish speakers. Somos hispanohablantes y sólo tenemos que practicar, hablar y anal izarpara perfeccionar nuestro español . My advice now for the end of the course is to spend some \\ntime practicing, to get out and practice and expose yourself to Spanish as much as possible. And \\nthen maybe after a short while of practicing, you might want t o repeat the course to refresh and \\ntouch up on anything that you might be unsure of, especially having practiced and being solid on \\nso many things it will really free up a lot of mental space to home in on the things that you are \\nmore uncertain with. And, in this way, repeating the course might be a little bit like when you \\nwatch a good movie twice and on the second time round you have a different experience.  \\nThe most important thing in this journey of exploring and improving your Spanish is to not to \\nforget to enjoy it, to not obsess with the destination but to enjoy the journey. You are already a \\nSpanish speaker, you should enjoy it. There is a huge variety of literature, music, and cinema \\ncoming from Spanish speaking countries , so you can enjoy this an d at the same time effectively \\nbe studying, but it won’t feel like that. And we must bear in mind also that listening is a separate \\nskill. You will hear many things that you could think your way through and say and maybe not \\nunderstand them. So when you fi rst begin listening, don’t be overwhelmed by the fact that you \\ndon’t understand at the beginning as much as you can speak. All you have to do is insist on \\nanalyzing the language that you are exposed to, breaking it up and seeing what you can learn from \\nthat and although at the beginning it will seem very fast, once you get in the habit of this analysis \\nand this breaking up of the language in the same way that we were doing when we were building \\nup to create our sentences, in reverse deconstructing what you hear. The more you do this, the \\nmore Spanish will slow down. It will slow right down and you’ll hear a lot more. So like I said, \\ndon’t be overwhelmed by not understanding a lot at the beginning, insist, enjoy music, watch \\nmovies with subtitles, try to matc h between the subtitles in English and what you are hearing in \\nSpanish. And just try to match bits and pieces. If you insist with this , very quickly  you will notice \\nthat you are understanding a lot more and that the language appears to slow right down.  \\nThank you very much for participating in the Language Transfer project just by doing the course. \\nPlease share it. Language Transfer is a completely independent and unfunded project, so we don’t \\nhave any funds for the diffusion of this course. If this cour se got to you, it’s because somebody \\nshared it, so please do keep sharing and telling people about this way of learning so that they also \\nmight enjoy this experience for free. All of our courses are completely free to promote language \\nlearning and to allow  anybody to have this experience anywhere in the world, but of course thefact that the courses are free doesn’t mean that we are immune to the world of monetary economics. \\nWe produce courses much slower than what we would like to, due to a lack of funds . So when you \\ndonate , actually what you’re donating is time that we are then able to spend on the construction, \\npractice, and recording of new courses. If you’d like more information on the Language Transfer \\nproject, what we’re doing, and why, then chec k out our website www.languagetransfer.org . We \\nreally hope you enjoy using your new language and the new world that it opens up to you. Strangely \\nthe same one that was there all along.']"

With the thinking method, \\nwe are not just interested in teaching you Spanish in record time, but also about exploring the thinking \\nprocesses, abilities, and habits which make us effective and confide nt language learners in control of \\nour own learning process. This will give you a more intimate relationship with your new language \\nand the greater ability to express yourself through the mechanisms that language offers.  \\nWe will reconstruct the langua ge together in a way that will give you all of the know -how to \\novercome your technical difficulties in that language, so that you can concentrate on achieving and \\nenjoying a freedom in your new language.  \\nThe course has been recorded with a volunteer s tudent and is a genuine real life learning \\nexperience. The volunteer student does not have a script, and she’s not acting. Recording in this way \\nhas allowed us to capture the essence of the learning experience with the thinking method . During the \\nlength o f the course, I will be asking the volunteer student to perform various mental exercises, \\nresulting in the construction of sentences. When I do so, you will pause the audio and complete the \\ntask yourself, and then continue listening to see how our voluntee r student answered. It is important \\nto understand that these are exercises and not tests.  \\nDo not rush to answer. Take your time to think through your answer at your own pace, building it \\nup piece by piece with the instructions you received during the audio, which are as much about the \\nlanguage as they are about the mental processes.  \\nIt is very important that you don’t try to memorize anything. Memorization is an extremely \\ndistracting process, and I need you 100% here with us.

So when you \\ndonate , actually what you’re donating is time that we are then able to spend on the construction, \\npractice, and recording of new courses. If you’d like more information on the Language Transfer \\nproject, what we’re doing, and why, then chec k out our website www.languagetransfer.org .
